1+ Hear this, all peoples!
2+ both low and high,
3My mouth shall speak + wisdom;
4I will incline my ear to + a proverb;
5+ Why should I fear in + times of trouble,
6those who + trust in their wealth
7Truly no man + can ransom another,
8for + the ransom of their life is costly
9that he should live on forever
10For he sees + that even the wise die;
11Their + graves are their homes forever,+ 
12Man in his pomp + will not remain;
13This is the path of those who have + foolish confidence;
14Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol;
15But God will + ransom my soul from the power of Sheol,
16Be not afraid when a man becomes rich,
17+ For when he dies he will + carry nothing away;
18For though, while he lives, he counts himself + blessed
19his soul will + go to the generation of his fathers,
20+ Man in his pomp yet without understanding is like the beasts that perish.
