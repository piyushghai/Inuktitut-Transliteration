1Dead flies make + the perfumer’s ointment give off a stench;
2+ A wise man’s heart inclines him to the right,
3Even when the fool walks on the road, he lacks sense,
4If the anger of the ruler rises against you, + do not leave your place,
5There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, as it were + an error proceeding from the ruler: 
6+ folly is set in many high places, and the rich sit in a low place. 
7+ I have seen slaves + on horses, and princes walking on the ground like slaves.
8He who + digs a pit will fall into it,
9+ He who quarries stones is hurt by them,
10If the iron is blunt, and one does not sharpen the edge,
11If the serpent bites before it is + charmed,
12The words of a wise man’s mouth + win him favor,+ 
13The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness,
14+ A fool multiplies words,
15The toil of a fool wearies him,
16+ Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child,
17Happy are you, O land, when your king is the son of the nobility,
18Through sloth the roof sinks in,
19Bread is made for laughter,
20Even in your thoughts, + do not curse the king,
