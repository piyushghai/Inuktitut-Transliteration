1Behold, + the Lord will empty the earth+  and make it desolate,
2+ And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest;
3+ The earth shall be utterly empty and utterly plundered;
4+ The earth mourns and withers;
5The earth lies + defiled
6Therefore + a curse devours the earth,
7+ The wine mourns,
8+ The mirth of the tambourines is stilled,
9No more do they drink wine + with singing;
10+ The wasted city is broken down;
11+ There is an outcry in the streets for lack of wine;
12Desolation is left in the city;
13For thus it shall be in the midst of the earth
14They lift up their voices, they sing for joy;
15+ Therefore in the east+  give glory to the Lord;
16+ From the ends of the earth we hear songs of praise,
17+ Terror and the pit and the snare+ 
18+ He who flees at the sound of the terror
19The earth is utterly broken,
20The earth + staggers like a drunken man;
21On that day the Lord will punish
22+ They will be gathered together
23+ Then the moon will be confounded
