1+ An oracle concerning + Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum of Elkosh.
2+ The Lord is a jealous and avenging God;
3+ The Lord is slow to anger and + great in power,
4+ He rebukes the sea and makes it dry;
5+ The mountains quake before him;
6+ Who can stand before his indignation?
7+ The Lord is good,
8But + with an overflowing flood
9What + do you plot against the Lord?
10For they are + like entangled thorns,
11From you came one
12Thus says the Lord,
13And now + I will break his yoke from off you
14The Lord has given commandment about you:
15+ + Behold, upon the mountains, + the feet of him
