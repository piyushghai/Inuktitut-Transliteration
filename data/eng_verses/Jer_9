1+ + Oh that my head were waters,
2+  Oh that I had in the desert
3+ They bend their tongue like a bow;
4+ Let everyone beware of his neighbor,
5Everyone deceives his neighbor,
6Heaping oppression upon oppression, and deceit upon deceit,
7Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts:
8+ Their tongue is a deadly arrow;
9+ Shall I not punish them for these things? declares the Lord,
10“I will take up weeping and wailing for the mountains,
11+ I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins,
12+ Who is the man so wise that he can understand this? To whom has the mouth of the Lord spoken, that he may declare it? Why is the land ruined + and laid waste like a wilderness, so that no one passes through? 
13And the Lord says: + “Because they have forsaken my law that I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice or walked in accord with it, 
14but + have stubbornly followed their own hearts and have gone after the Baals, as their fathers taught them. 
15Therefore thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: + Behold, I will feed this people with bitter food, and give them + poisonous water to drink. 
16+ I will scatter them among the nations + whom neither they nor their fathers have known, and I will + send the sword after them, until I have consumed them.”
17Thus says the Lord of hosts:
18let them make haste + and raise a wailing over us,
19For a sound of wailing is heard from Zion:
20Hear, O women, the word of the Lord,
21For death has come up into our windows;
22Speak: “Thus declares the Lord,
23Thus says the Lord: + “Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let not the mighty man boast in his might, let not the rich man boast in his riches, 
24but + let him who boasts boast in this, that he understands and knows me, that I am the Lord who practices steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the earth. + For in these things I delight, declares the Lord.”
25“Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when + I will punish all those who are circumcised merely in the flesh— 
26+ Egypt, Judah, Edom, the sons of Ammon, Moab, and + all who dwell in the desert who cut the corners of their hair, for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are + uncircumcised in heart.”
