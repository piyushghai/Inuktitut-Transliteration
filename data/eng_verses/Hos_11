1+ When Israel was a child, + I loved him,
2+ The more they were called,
3Yet it was + I who taught Ephraim to walk;
4+ I led them with cords of kindness,+ 
5+ They shall not+  return to the land of Egypt,
6+ The sword shall rage against their cities,
7My people are bent + on turning away from me,
8How can I give you up, O Ephraim?
9I will not execute my burning anger;
10+ They shall go after the Lord;
11they shall come trembling like birds + from Egypt,
12+  Ephraim + has surrounded me with lies,
