1O God, you are my God; + earnestly I seek you;
2So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary,
3Because your + steadfast love is better than life,
4So I will bless you + as long as I live;
5My soul will be + satisfied as with fat and rich food,
6when I remember you + upon my bed,
7for you have been my help,
8My soul + clings to you;
9But those who seek to destroy my life
10they shall be given over to the power of the sword;
11But + the king shall rejoice in God;
