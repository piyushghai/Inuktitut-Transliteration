1Then Moses and the people of Israel + sang this song to the Lord, saying,
2+ The Lord is my strength and my + song,
3The Lord is + a man of war;
4+ “Pharaoh’s chariots and his host he cast into the sea,
5The + floods covered them;
6+ Your right hand, O Lord, glorious in power,
7In the + greatness of your majesty you overthrow your adversaries;
8At the + blast of your nostrils the waters piled up;
9The enemy said, + ‘I will pursue, I will overtake,
10You + blew with your wind; the + sea covered them;
11+ “Who is like you, O Lord, among the gods?
12You stretched out + your right hand;
13“You have + led in your steadfast love the people whom + you have redeemed;
14+ The peoples have heard; they tremble;
15Now are the chiefs of Edom + dismayed;
16Terror and + dread fall upon them;
17You will bring them in and + plant them on your own mountain,
18+ The Lord will reign forever and ever.”
19For when + the horses of Pharaoh with his chariots and his horsemen went into the sea, + the Lord brought back the waters of the sea upon them, but the people of Israel walked on dry ground in the midst of the sea. 
20Then + Miriam + the prophetess, the + sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand, and + all the women went out after her with tambourines and dancing. 
21And Miriam sang to them:
22Then Moses made Israel set out from the Red Sea, and they went into the wilderness of + Shur. They went three days in the wilderness and found no water. 
23When they came to + Marah, they could not drink the water of Marah because it was bitter; therefore it was named Marah.+ 
24And the people + grumbled against Moses, saying, “What shall we drink?” 
25And he + cried to the Lord, and the Lord showed him a log,+  and he + threw it into the water, and the water became sweet.
26saying, + “If you will diligently listen to the voice of the Lord your God, and do that which is right in his eyes, and give ear to his commandments and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the + diseases on you that I put on the Egyptians, for I am the Lord, + your healer.”
27Then + they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees, and they encamped there by the water.
