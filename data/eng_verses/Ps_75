1We give thanks to you, O God;
2“At + the set time that I appoint
3When the earth + totters, and all its inhabitants,
4I say to the boastful, ‘Do not boast,’
5do not lift up your horn on high,
6For not from the east or from the west
7but it is + God who executes judgment,
8+ For in the hand of the Lord there is + a cup
9But I will declare it forever;
10+ All the horns of the wicked I will cut off,
