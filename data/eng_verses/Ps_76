1In Judah God is + known;
2His + abode has been established in + Salem,
3There he + broke the flashing arrows,
4Glorious are you, more majestic
5+ The stouthearted were stripped of their spoil;
6At your rebuke, O God of Jacob,
7+ But you, you are to be feared!
8From the heavens you uttered judgment;
9when God + arose to establish judgment,
10Surely + the wrath of man shall praise you;
11+ Make your vows to the Lord your God and perform them;
12who + cuts off the spirit of princes,
