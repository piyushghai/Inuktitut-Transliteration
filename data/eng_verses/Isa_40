1+ Comfort, comfort my people, says your God.
2+ Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,
3+ A voice cries:+ 
4+ Every valley shall be lifted up,
5+ And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed,
6A voice says, “Cry!”
7The grass withers, the flower fades
8+ The grass withers, the flower fades,
9Go on up to a high mountain,
10+ Behold, the Lord God comes with might,
11+ He will tend his flock like a shepherd;
12+ Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand
13+ Who has measured+  the Spirit of the Lord,
14Whom did he consult,
15Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket,
16Lebanon would not suffice for fuel,
17+ All the nations are as nothing before him,
18+ To whom then will you liken God,
19+ An idol! A craftsman casts it,
20+ He who is too impoverished for an offering
21+ Do you not know? Do you not hear?
22It is he who sits above the circle of the earth,
23+ who brings princes to nothing,
24Scarcely are they planted, scarcely sown,
25+ To whom then will you compare me,
26Lift up your eyes on high and see:
27Why do you say, O Jacob,
28Have you not known? Have you not heard?
29He gives power to the faint,
30Even youths shall faint and be weary,
31but + they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength;
