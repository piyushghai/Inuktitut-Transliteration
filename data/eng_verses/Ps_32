1+ Blessed is the one whose + transgression is forgiven,
2Blessed is the man against whom the Lord+ counts no iniquity,
3For when I kept silent, my + bones wasted away
4For day and night your + hand was heavy upon me;
5I + acknowledged my sin to you,
6Therefore let everyone who is + godly
7You are a + hiding place for me;
8I will + instruct you and teach you in the way you should go;
9+ Be not like a horse or a mule, without understanding,
10+ Many are the sorrows of the wicked,
11+ Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, O righteous,
