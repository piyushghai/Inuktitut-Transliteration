1But now thus says the Lord,
2+ When you pass through the waters, I will be with you;
3For + I am the Lord your God,
4Because you are precious in my eyes,
5+ Fear not, for I am with you;
6I will say to the north, Give up,
7everyone who is called by my name,
8Bring out + the people who are blind, yet have eyes,
9+ All the nations gather together,
10+ “You are my witnesses,” declares the Lord,
11+ I, I am the Lord,
12I declared and saved and proclaimed,
13Also + henceforth I am he;
14Thus says the Lord,
15I am the Lord, your Holy One,
16Thus says the Lord,
17who + brings forth chariot and horse,
18+ “Remember not the former things,
19+ Behold, I am doing a new thing;
20The wild beasts will honor me,
21the people whom I formed for myself
22“Yet you did not call upon me, O Jacob;
23+ You have not brought me your sheep for burnt offerings,
24You have not bought me sweet cane with money,
25“I, I am he
26Put me in remembrance; + let us argue together;
27+ Your first father sinned,
28Therefore + I will profane the princes of the sanctuary,
