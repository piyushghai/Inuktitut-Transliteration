1+ Vindicate me, O Lord,
2+ Prove me, O Lord, and try me;
3For your + steadfast love is before my eyes,
4I do not + sit with men of + falsehood,
5I + hate the assembly of evildoers,
6I + wash my hands in innocence
7proclaiming thanksgiving aloud,
8O Lord, I + love the habitation of your house
9+ Do not sweep my soul away with sinners,
10in whose hands are evil devices,
11But as for me, I shall walk in my integrity;
12My foot stands on + level ground;
