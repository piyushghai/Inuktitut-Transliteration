1The allotment for the tribe of the people of Judah according to their clans reached southward + to the boundary of Edom, to + the wilderness of Zin at the farthest south. 
2And their south boundary ran from the end of the + Salt Sea, from the bay that faces southward. 
3It goes out southward of + the ascent of Akrabbim, passes along to Zin, and goes up south of Kadesh-barnea, along by Hezron, up to Addar, turns about to Karka, 
4passes along to Azmon, goes out by + the Brook of Egypt, and comes to its end at the sea. This shall be your south boundary. 
5And the east boundary is the + Salt Sea, to the mouth of the Jordan. And the boundary on the north side runs from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan. 
6And the boundary goes up to + Beth-hoglah and passes along north of + Beth-arabah. And the boundary goes up to + the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. 
7And the boundary goes up to Debir from + the Valley of Achor, and so northward, turning toward Gilgal, which is opposite + the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the valley. And the boundary passes along to the waters of + En-shemesh and ends at + En-rogel. 
8Then the boundary goes up by + the Valley of the Son of Hinnom at the southern shoulder of the Jebusite (+ that is, Jerusalem). And the boundary goes up to the top of the mountain that lies over against the Valley of Hinnom, on the west, at the northern end of the Valley + of Rephaim. 
9Then the boundary extends from the top of the mountain + to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, and from there to the cities of Mount Ephron. Then the boundary bends around to Baalah (+ that is, Kiriath-jearim). 
10And the boundary circles west of Baalah to Mount Seir, passes along to the northern shoulder of Mount Jearim (that is, Chesalon), and goes down to + Beth-shemesh and passes along by + Timnah. 
11The boundary goes out + to the shoulder of the hill north of Ekron, then the boundary bends around to Shikkeron and passes along to Mount + Baalah and goes out to Jabneel. Then the boundary comes to an end at the sea. 
12And the west boundary was + the Great Sea with its coastline. This is the boundary around the people of Judah according to their clans.
13According to the commandment of the Lord to Joshua, he gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh a portion among the people of Judah, + Kiriath-arba, that is, + Hebron (Arba was the father of Anak). 
14And Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak, + Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai, the descendants of Anak. 
15And he went up from there against the inhabitants of Debir. + Now the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher. 
16And Caleb said, “Whoever strikes Kiriath-sepher and captures it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife.” 
17+ And Othniel the son of Kenaz, + the brother of Caleb, captured it. And he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife. 
18When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. And she got off her donkey, and Caleb said to her, “What do you want?” 
19She said to him, “Give me a blessing. Since you have given me the land of the Negeb, give me also springs of water.” And he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
