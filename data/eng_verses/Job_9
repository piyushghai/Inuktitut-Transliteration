1Then Job answered and said:
2“Truly I know that it is so:
3If one wished to + contend with him,
4He is + wise in heart and mighty in strength
5he who removes mountains, and they know it not,
6who + shakes the earth out of its place,
7who commands the sun, and it does not rise;
8who alone + stretched out the heavens
9who + made + the Bear and + Orion,
10who does + great things beyond searching out,
11Behold, he passes by me, and I + see him not;
12Behold, he snatches away; + who can turn him back?
13“God will not turn back his anger;
14+ How then can I + answer him,
15+ Though I am in the right, I cannot answer him;
16If I summoned him and he answered me,
17For he crushes me with a tempest
18he will not let me get my breath,
19If it is a contest of + strength, behold, he is mighty!
20Though I am in the right, + my own mouth would condemn me;
21I am + blameless; I regard not myself;
22It is all one; therefore I say,
23When + disaster brings sudden death,
24+ The earth is given into the hand of the wicked;
25“My + days are swifter than + a runner;
26They go by like + skiffs of reed,
27If I say, + ‘I will forget my complaint,
28I become + afraid of all my suffering,
29I shall be + condemned;
30If I wash myself with snow
31yet you will plunge me into a pit,
32For he is not a man, as I am, that I might answer him,
33+ There is no+  arbiter between us,
34+ Let him take his + rod away from me,
35Then I would speak without fear of him,
