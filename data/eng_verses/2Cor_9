1Now + it is superfluous for me to write to you about + the ministry for the saints, 
2for I know your readiness, + of which I boast about you to the people of Macedonia, saying that Achaia has been ready + since last year. And your zeal has stirred up most of them. 
3But + I am sending+  the brothers so that our boasting about you may not prove empty in this matter, so that you may be ready, + as I said you would be. 
4Otherwise, if some Macedonians + come with me and find that you are not ready, we would be humiliated—to say nothing of you—for being so confident. 
5So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance for the + gift+  you have promised, so that it may be ready + as a willing gift, + not as an exaction.+ 
6The point is this: + whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully+  will also reap bountifully. 
7Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, + not reluctantly or under compulsion, for + God loves a cheerful giver. 
8And + God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency+  in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work. 
9As it is written,
10He who supplies + seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and + increase the harvest of your righteousness. 
11+ You will be enriched in every way to be generous in every way, which + through us will produce thanksgiving to God. 
12For the ministry of this service is not only supplying + the needs of the saints but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God. 
13By their approval of this service, + they+  will glorify God because of your submission that comes from your + confession of the gospel of Christ, and the generosity of your contribution for them and for all others, 
14while they long for you and pray for you, because of the surpassing grace of God upon you. 
15+ Thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift!
