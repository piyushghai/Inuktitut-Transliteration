1And the Lord said to me, + “Go again, love a woman who is loved by another man and is an adulteress, even as the Lord loves the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love cakes of raisins.” 
2So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and a + homer and a lethech+  of barley. 
3And I said to her, “You must + dwell as mine for many days. You shall not play the whore, or belong to another man; so will I also be to you.” 
4For the children of Israel + shall dwell many days + without king or prince, + without sacrifice or + pillar, without + ephod or + household gods. 
5Afterward + the children of Israel shall return and + seek the Lord their God, and + David their king, + and they shall come in fear to the Lord and to his goodness in the + latter days.
