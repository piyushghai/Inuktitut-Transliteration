1May the Lord+ answer you in the day of trouble!
2May he send you help from + the sanctuary
3May he + remember all your offerings
4May he + grant you your heartâ€™s desire
5May we shout for joy over + your salvation,
6Now I know that the Lord saves his anointed;
7Some trust in + chariots and some in + horses,
8They collapse and fall,
9O Lord, save + the king!
