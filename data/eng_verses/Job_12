1Then Job answered and said:
2“No doubt you are the people,
3But I have + understanding as well as you;
4I am + a laughingstock to my friends;
5In the thought of one who is + at ease there is contempt for misfortune;
6+ The tents of robbers are at peace,
7“But ask the beasts, and they will teach you;
8or the bushes of the earth,+  and they will teach you;
9Who among all these does not know
10In + his hand is the life of every living thing
11Does not + the ear test words
12Wisdom is with + the aged,
13+ “With God+  are wisdom and might;
14If he tears down, none can rebuild;
15If he + withholds the waters, they dry up;
16With him are strength and + sound wisdom;
17He leads + counselors away stripped,
18He + looses the bonds of kings
19He leads priests away stripped
20He deprives of speech those who are trusted
21He + pours contempt on princes
22He + uncovers the deeps out of darkness
23He + makes nations great, and he destroys them;
24He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth
25They + grope in the dark without light,
