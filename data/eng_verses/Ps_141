1O Lord, I call upon you; + hasten to me!
2Let + my prayer be counted as incense before you,
3+ Set a guard, O Lord, over my mouth;
4+ Do not let my heart incline to any evil,
5+ Let a righteous man strike meâ€”it is a kindness;
6When their judges are + thrown over the cliff,+ 
7As when one plows and breaks up the earth,
8But + my eyes are toward you, O God, my Lord;
9Keep me from + the trap that they have laid for me
10Let the wicked + fall into their own nets,
