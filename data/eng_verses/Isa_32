1Behold, + a king will reign in righteousness,
2+ Each will be like a hiding place from the wind,
3+ Then the eyes of those who see will not be closed,
4The heart of the hasty will understand and know,
5+ The fool will no more be called noble,
6For + the fool speaks folly,
7As for the scoundrelâ€”+ his devices are evil;
8But he who is noble plans noble things,
9+ Rise up, you women + who are at ease, hear my voice;
10In little more than a year
11Tremble, you women + who are at ease,
12+ Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields,
13+ for the soil of my people
14For the palace is forsaken,
15until + the Spirit is poured upon us from on high,
16Then justice will dwell in the wilderness,
17+ And the effect of righteousness will be peace,
18My people will abide in a peaceful habitation,
19+ And it will hail when the forest falls down,
20+ Happy are you who sow beside all waters,
