1The righteous man perishes,
2+ he enters into peace;
3But you, draw near,
4Whom are you mocking?
5you who burn with lust among + the oaks,+ 
6Among the smooth stones of + the valley is your portion;
7+ On a high and lofty mountain
8Behind the door and the doorpost
9You journeyed to the king with oil
10You were wearied with the length of your way,
11+ Whom did you dread and fear,
12I will declare your righteousness and your deeds,
13+ When you cry out, let your collection of idols deliver you!
14And it shall be said,
15For thus says + the One who is high and lifted up,
16+ For I will not contend forever,
17Because of the iniquity of his + unjust gain I was angry,
18I have seen his ways, + but I will heal him;
19+ creating + the fruit of the lips.
20+ But the wicked are like the tossing sea;
21+ There is no peace,” says my God, “for the wicked.”
