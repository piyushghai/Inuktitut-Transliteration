1Praise + is due to you,+  O God, in Zion,
2O you who + hear prayer,
3When + iniquities prevail against me,
4+ Blessed is the one you choose and bring near,
5By + awesome deeds you answer us with righteousness,
6the one who by his strength established the mountains,
7who + stills the roaring of the seas,
8so that those who dwell at the ends of the earth are in awe at your signs.
9You visit the earth and + water it;+ 
10You water its furrows abundantly,
11You crown the year with your bounty;
12+ The pastures of the wilderness overflow,
13+ the meadows clothe themselves with flocks,
