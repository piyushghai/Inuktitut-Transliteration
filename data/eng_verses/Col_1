1Paul, + an apostle of Christ Jesus + by the will of God, and Timothy + our brother,
2To the + saints and faithful brothers+  in Christ at Colossae:
3+ We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you, 
4since we heard of + your faith in Christ Jesus and of + the love that you have for all the saints, 
5because of + the hope + laid up for you in heaven. Of this you have heard before in + the word of the truth, the gospel, 
6which has come to you, as indeed + in the whole world it is + bearing fruit and increasing—as it also does among you, since the day you + heard it and understood + the grace of God in truth, 
7just as you learned it from + Epaphras our beloved + fellow servant.+  He is + a faithful minister of Christ on your+  behalf 
8and has made known to us your + love in the Spirit.
9And so, + from the day we heard, + we have not ceased to pray for you, asking that + you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all + spiritual wisdom and understanding, 
10so as + to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, + fully pleasing to him, + bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God. 
11+ May you be strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might, for + all endurance and patience + with joy, 
12+ giving thanks+  to the Father, who has qualified you+  to share in + the inheritance of the saints in light. 
13He + has delivered us from + the domain of darkness and transferred us to + the kingdom of + his beloved Son, 
14+ in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
15+ He is the image of + the invisible God, + the firstborn of all creation. 
16For by+  him all things were created, + in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether + thrones or + dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created + through him and for him. 
17And + he is before all things, and in him all things + hold together. 
18And + he is the head of the body, the church. He is + the beginning, + the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent. 
19For + in him all the + fullness of God was pleased to dwell, 
20and + through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, + making peace + by the blood of his cross.
21+ And you, who once were alienated and hostile in mind, + doing evil deeds, 
22he has now reconciled + in his body of flesh by his death, + in order to present you holy and blameless and + above reproach before him, 
23+ if indeed you continue in the faith, + stable and steadfast, not shifting from + the hope of the gospel that you heard, which has been proclaimed + in all creation+  under heaven, + and of which I, Paul, became a minister.
24Now + I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh + I am filling up + what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions + for the sake of his body, that is, the church, 
25+ of which I became a minister according to + the stewardship from God that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known, 
26+ the mystery hidden for ages and generations but now revealed to his saints. 
27+ To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are + the riches of the glory of + this mystery, which is Christ in you, + the hope of glory. 
28Him we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom, that + we may present everyone + mature in Christ. 
29For this + I toil, + struggling + with all his energy that he powerfully works within me.
