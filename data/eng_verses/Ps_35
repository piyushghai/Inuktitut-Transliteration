1Contend, O Lord, with those who + contend with me;
2Take hold of + shield and buckler
3Draw the spear and javelin+ 
4+ Let them be + put to shame and dishonor
5Let them be like + chaff before the wind,
6Let their way be dark and + slippery,
7For + without cause + they hid their net for me;
8Let + destruction come upon him + when he does not know it!
9Then my soul will rejoice in the Lord,
10All my + bones shall say,
11+ Malicious+  witnesses rise up;
12+ They repay me evil for good;
13But I, + when they were sickâ€”
14I went about as though I grieved for my friend or my brother;
15But at my stumbling they rejoiced and gathered;
16like profane mockers at a feast,+ 
17How long, O Lord, will you + look on?
18I will thank you in + the great congregation;
19+ Let not those rejoice over me
20For they do not speak peace,
21They + open wide their mouths against me;
22+ You have seen, O Lord; + be not silent!
23Awake and + rouse yourself for + my vindication,
24+ Vindicate me, O Lord, my God,
25Let them not say in their hearts,
26Let them be + put to shame and disappointed altogether
27Let those who delight in my righteousness
28Then my + tongue shall tell of your righteousness
