1There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of + Jesse,
2And + the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him,
3And his delight shall be in the fear of the Lord.
4but + with righteousness he shall judge the poor,
5Righteousness shall be the belt of his waist,
6+ The wolf shall dwell with the lamb,
7The cow and the bear shall graze;
8The nursing child shall play over the hole of the cobra,
9+ They shall not hurt or destroy
10In that day + the root of + Jesse, who shall stand as + a signal for the peoplesâ€”of him shall the nations inquire, and his resting place shall be glorious.
11+ In that day the Lord will extend his hand yet a second time to recover the remnant that remains of his people, + from Assyria, + from Egypt, from + Pathros, from + Cush,+  from + Elam, from + Shinar, from + Hamath, and from + the coastlands of the sea.
12He will raise + a signal for the nations
13+ The jealousy of Ephraim shall depart,
14+ But they shall swoop down on the shoulder of the Philistines in the west,
15And the Lord will utterly destroy+ 
16And there will be + a highway from Assyria
