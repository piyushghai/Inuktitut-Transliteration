1For + freedom Christ has + set us free; + stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to + a yoke of + slavery.
2Look: I, Paul, say to you that + if you accept circumcision, + Christ will be of no advantage to you. 
3I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision that + he is obligated to keep the whole law. 
4You are + severed from Christ, + you who would be justified+  by the law; + you have fallen away from grace. 
5For through the Spirit, by faith, we ourselves eagerly + wait for the hope of righteousness. 
6For in Christ Jesus + neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but + only faith working through love.
7+ You were running well. Who hindered you from obeying + the truth? 
8This persuasion is not from + him who calls you. 
9+ A little leaven leavens the whole lump. 
10+ I have confidence in the Lord that you will + take no other view, and + the one who is troubling you will bear the penalty, whoever he is. 
11But if I, brothers,+  still preach+  circumcision, + why am I still being persecuted? In that case + the offense of the cross has been removed. 
12I wish + those who unsettle you would emasculate themselves!
13For you were called to freedom, brothers. + Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love + serve one another. 
14For + the whole law is fulfilled in one word: + “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” 
15But if you + bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another.
16But I say, + walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify + the desires of the flesh. 
17For + the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, + to keep you from doing the things you want to do. 
18But if you are + led by the Spirit, + you are not under the law. 
19Now + the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, 
20idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, + divisions, 
21envy,+  drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that + those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. 
22But + the fruit of the Spirit is + love, joy, peace, patience, + kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 
23+ gentleness, + self-control; + against such things there is no law. 
24And those who belong to Christ Jesus + have crucified the flesh with its + passions and desires.
25If we live by the Spirit, + let us also keep in step with the Spirit. 
26+ Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.
