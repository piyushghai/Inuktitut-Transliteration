1+ When I would heal Israel,
2But they do not consider
3By their evil + they make + the king glad,
4+ They are all adulterers;
5On the day of + our king, the princes
6For with hearts like an oven + they approach their intrigue;
7All of them are hot as an oven,
8Ephraim + mixes himself with the peoples;
9+ Strangers devour his strength,
10+ The pride of Israel testifies to his face;+ 
11Ephraim is like a dove,
12As they go, + I will spread over them my net;
13+ Woe to them, for they have strayed from me!
14+ They do not cry to me from the heart,
15Although + I trained and strengthened their arms,
16They + return, but not upward;+
