1On my bed + by night
2I will rise now and go about the city,
3+ The watchmen found me
4Scarcely had I passed them
5+ I adjure you, + O daughters of Jerusalem,
6+ What is that coming up from the wilderness
7Behold, it is the litter+  of Solomon!
8all of them wearing swords
9King Solomon made himself a carriage+ 
10He made its posts of silver,
11Go out, O + daughters of Zion,
