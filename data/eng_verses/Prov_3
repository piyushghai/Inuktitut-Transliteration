1+ My son, do not forget my teaching,
2for + length of days and years of life
3Let not + steadfast love and + faithfulness forsake you;
4So you will + find favor and + good success+ 
5+ Trust in the Lord with all your heart,
6In all your ways + acknowledge him,
7+ Be not wise in your own eyes;
8It will be + healing to your flesh+ 
9Honor the Lord with your wealth
10then your + barns will be filled with plenty,
11+ My son, do not despise the Lord’s discipline
12for the Lord reproves him whom he loves,
13+ Blessed is the one who finds wisdom,
14+ for the gain from her is better than gain from silver
15She is more precious than + jewels,
16+ Long life is in her right hand;
17Her + ways are ways of pleasantness,
18She is + a tree of life to those who + lay hold of her;
19+ The Lord by wisdom founded the earth;
20by his knowledge + the deeps broke open,
21My son, + do not lose sight of these—
22and they will be + life for your soul
23+ Then you will walk on your way securely,
24+ If you lie down, you will not be afraid;
25+ Do not be afraid of sudden terror
26for the Lord will be your confidence
27+ Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due,+ 
28+ Do not say to your neighbor, “Go, and come again,
29+ Do not plan evil against your neighbor,
30+ Do not contend with a man for no reason,
31+ Do not envy + a man of violence
32for + the devious person is an abomination to the Lord,
33+ The Lord’s curse is on the house of the wicked,
34Toward the + scorners he + is scornful,
35The wise will inherit honor,
