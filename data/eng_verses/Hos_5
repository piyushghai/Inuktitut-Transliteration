1+ Hear this, O priests!
2And + the revolters + have gone deep into slaughter,
3+ I know Ephraim,
4+ Their deeds do not permit them
5+ The pride of Israel testifies to his face;+ 
6+ With their flocks and herds they shall go
7+ They have dealt faithlessly with the Lord;
8+ Blow the horn in + Gibeah,
9Ephraim shall become a desolation
10The princes of Judah have become
11Ephraim is + oppressed, crushed in judgment,
12But I am + like a moth to Ephraim,
13When Ephraim saw his sickness,
14For I will be + like a lion to + Ephraim,
15+ I will return again to my place,
