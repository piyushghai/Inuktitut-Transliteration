1+ Oh sing to the Lord+ a new song;
2Sing to the Lord, bless his name;
3Declare his glory among the nations,
4For + great is the Lord, and + greatly to be praised;
5For all the gods of the peoples are worthless idols,
6Splendor and majesty are before him;
7Ascribe to the Lord, O + families of the peoples,
8Ascribe to the Lord+ the glory due his name;
9Worship the Lord in + the splendor of holiness;+ 
10Say among the nations, + â€œThe Lord reigns!
11Let + the heavens be glad, and let + the earth rejoice;
12let + the field exult, and everything in it!
13before the Lord, for he comes,
