1O Lord, + God of my salvation;
2Let my prayer come before you;
3For my soul is full of troubles,
4I am counted among those who + go down to the pit;
5like one set loose among the dead,
6You have put me in + the depths of the pit,
7Your wrath + lies heavy upon me,
8You have caused + my companions to shun me;
9+ my eye grows dim through sorrow.
10Do you work wonders for the dead?
11Is your steadfast love declared in the grave,
12Are your + wonders known in + the darkness,
13But I, O Lord, cry + to you;
14O Lord, why + do you cast my soul away?
15Afflicted and close to death from my youth up,
16Your wrath has swept over me;
17They + surround me like a flood + all day long;
18You have caused + my beloved and my friend to shun me;
