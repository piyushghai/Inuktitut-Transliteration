1O Lord, + rebuke me not in your anger,
2For your + arrows have sunk into me,
3There is + no soundness in my flesh
4For my + iniquities have gone over my head;
5My wounds stink and fester
6I am + utterly bowed down and + prostrate;
7For my sides are filled with burning,
8I am feeble and crushed;
9O Lord, all my longing is before you;
10My heart throbs; my strength fails me,
11My + friends and companions + stand aloof from my + plague,
12Those who seek my life + lay their snares;
13But I am like a deaf man; I do not hear,
14I have become like a man who does not hear,
15But for + you, O Lord, do I wait;
16For I said, â€œOnly + let them not rejoice over me,
17For I am + ready to fall,
18I + confess my iniquity;
19But my foes are vigorous, they are mighty,
20Those who + render me evil for good
21Do not forsake me, O Lord!
22+ Make haste to help me,
