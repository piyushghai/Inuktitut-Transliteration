1Therefore + let us leave + the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance + from dead works and of faith toward God, 
2and of + instruction about washings,+ + the laying on of hands, + the resurrection of the dead, and + eternal judgment. 
3And this we will do + if God permits. 
4For it is impossible, in the case of those + who have once been enlightened, who have tasted + the heavenly gift, and + have shared in the Holy Spirit, 
5and + have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come, 
6and + then have fallen away, to restore them again to repentance, since + they are crucifying once again the Son of God to their own harm and holding him up to contempt. 
7For + land that has drunk the rain that often falls on it, and produces a crop useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God. 
8But + if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed, + and its end is to be burned.
9Though we speak in this way, yet in your case, beloved, we feel sure of better things—things that belong to salvation. 
10For + God is not unjust so as to overlook + your work and the love that you have shown for his name in + serving the saints, as you still do. 
11And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness to have the full assurance + of hope until the end, 
12so that you may not be sluggish, but + imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
13For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear, + he swore by himself, 
14saying, + “Surely I will bless you and multiply you.” 
15And thus Abraham,+ + having patiently waited, obtained the promise. 
16For people swear by something greater than themselves, and in all their disputes + an oath is final for confirmation. 
17So when God desired to show more convincingly to + the heirs of the promise + the unchangeable character of his purpose, + he guaranteed it with an oath, 
18so that by two unchangeable things, in which + it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope + set before us. 
19We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into + the inner place behind the curtain, 
20where Jesus has gone + as a forerunner on our behalf, + having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
