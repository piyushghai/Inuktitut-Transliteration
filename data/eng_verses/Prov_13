1A wise son hears his father’s instruction,
2From the fruit of his mouth a man + eats what is good,
3+ Whoever guards his mouth preserves his life;
4+ The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing,
5The righteous hates falsehood,
6+ Righteousness guards him whose + way is blameless,
7+ One pretends to be rich, yet has nothing;
8The ransom of a man’s life is his wealth,
9+ The light of the righteous rejoices,
10+ By insolence comes nothing but strife,
11+ Wealth gained hastily+  will dwindle,
12Hope deferred makes the heart sick,
13Whoever + despises + the word brings destruction on himself,
14The teaching of the wise is + a fountain of life,
15+ Good sense wins + favor,
16+ In everything the prudent acts with knowledge,
17A wicked messenger falls into trouble,
18Poverty and disgrace come to him who + ignores instruction,
19+ A desire fulfilled is sweet to the soul,
20Whoever walks with the wise becomes wise,
21+ Disaster+  pursues sinners,
22+ A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children,
23The fallow ground of the poor would yield much food,
24+ Whoever spares the rod hates his son,
25+ The righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite,
