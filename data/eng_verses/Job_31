1“I have made a covenant with my + eyes;
2What would be + my portion from God above
3Is not calamity for the unrighteous,
4+ Does not he see my ways
5“If I have walked with falsehood
6(Let me be + weighed in a just balance,
7if my step has turned aside from the way
8then let me + sow, and another eat,
9“If my heart has been enticed toward a woman,
10then let my wife + grind for another,
11For that would be a heinous crime;
12for that would be a fire + that consumes as far as Abaddon,
13“If I have rejected the cause of my manservant or my maidservant,
14what then shall I do when God rises up?
15Did + not he who made me in the womb make him?
16“If I have + withheld anything that the poor desired,
17or have eaten my morsel alone,
18(for from my youth the fatherless+  grew up with me as with a father,
19if I have seen anyone + perish for + lack of clothing,
20if his body has not + blessed me,+ 
21if I have raised my hand against + the fatherless,
22then let my shoulder blade fall from my shoulder,
23For I was + in terror of calamity from God,
24+ “If I have made gold my + trust
25if I have + rejoiced because my wealth was abundant
26+ if I have looked at the sun+  when it shone,
27and my heart has been secretly enticed,
28this also would be + an iniquity to be punished by the judges,
29“If I have + rejoiced at the ruin of him who hated me,
30(+ I have not let my mouth sin
31if the men of my tent have not said,
32(+ the sojourner has not lodged in the street;
33if I + have concealed my transgressions + as others do+ 
34because I stood in great fear of + the multitude,
35Oh, that I had one to hear me!
36Surely I would carry it on my + shoulder;
37I would give him an account of all my steps;
38“If my land has cried out against me
39+ if I have eaten its yield without payment
40let + thorns grow instead of wheat,
