1“At this also my heart trembles
2Keep listening to the thunder of his voice
3Under the whole heaven he lets it go,
4After it + his voice roars;
5God thunders wondrously with his voice;
6For to + the snow he says, ‘Fall on the earth,’
7He + seals up the hand of every man,
8Then the beasts go into their + lairs,
9From + its chamber + comes the whirlwind,
10By the breath of God + ice is given,
11He loads the thick cloud with moisture;
12They + turn around and around by his + guidance,
13Whether for + correction or for his + land
14“Hear this, O Job;
15Do you know how God lays his command upon them
16Do you know the balancings+  of the clouds,
17you whose garments are hot
18Can you, like him, + spread out the skies,
19Teach us what we shall say to him;
20Shall it be told him that I would speak?
21“And now no one looks on the light
22Out of the north comes golden splendor;
23The Almighty—we + cannot find him;
24Therefore men + fear him;
