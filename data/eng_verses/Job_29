1And Job again + took up his discourse, and said:
2“Oh, that I were as in the months of old,
3when his + lamp shone upon my head,
4as I was in my prime,+ 
5when the Almighty was yet with me,
6when my steps were + washed with + butter,
7When I went out to + the gate of the city,
8the young men saw me and withdrew,
9the princes refrained from talking
10the voice of the nobles was hushed,
11When the ear heard, it called me blessed,
12because I + delivered the poor who cried for help,
13+ The blessing of him who was + about to perish came upon me,
14I + put on righteousness, and it clothed me;
15I was + eyes to the blind
16I was a father to the needy,
17I + broke + the fangs of the unrighteous
18+ Then I thought, ‘I shall die in my + nest,
19my + roots spread out to + the waters,
20my glory fresh with me,
21“Men listened to me and waited
22After I spoke they did not speak again,
23They waited for me as for the rain,
24I smiled on them when they had no confidence,
25I chose their way and sat as chief,
