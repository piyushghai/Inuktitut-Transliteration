1Let me sing for my beloved
2He dug it and cleared it of stones,
3And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem
4+ What more was there to do for my vineyard,
5And now I will tell you
6I will make it a waste;
7+ For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts
8Woe to those who + join house to house,
9The Lord of hosts has sworn in my hearing:
10+ For ten acres+  of vineyard shall yield but one bath,
11Woe to those who + rise early in the morning,
12+ They have lyre and harp,
13Therefore my people go into exile
14Therefore Sheol has + enlarged its appetite
15+ Man is humbled, and each one is brought low,
16+ But the Lord of hosts is exalted+  in justice,
17Then shall the lambs graze + as in their pasture,
18Woe to those who draw iniquity with + cords of falsehood,
19who say: + â€œLet him be quick,
20Woe to + those who call evil good
21Woe to those who are + wise in their own eyes,
22Woe to those who are + heroes at drinking wine,
23who + acquit the guilty for a bribe,
24Therefore, + as the tongue of fire devours the stubble,
25Therefore + the anger of the Lord was kindled against his people,
26He will + raise a signal for nations far away,
27+ None is weary, none stumbles,
28+ their arrows are sharp,
29Their roaring is like a lion,
30They will growl over it on that day,
