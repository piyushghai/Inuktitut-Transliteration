1+ Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me,
2I cry out to God Most High,
3+ He will send from heaven and save me;
4My soul is in the midst of + lions;
5+ Be exalted, O God, above the heavens!
6They set + a net for my steps;
7+ My heart is + steadfast, O God,
8+ Awake, + my glory!+ 
9I will give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples;
10For your + steadfast love is great to the heavens,
11+ Be exalted, O God, above the heavens!
