1+ For the Lord will have compassion on Jacob and will again choose Israel, and + will set them in their own land, and + sojourners will join them and will attach themselves to the house of Jacob. 
2And + the peoples will take them and bring them to their place, and the house of Israel will possess them in the Lord’s land + as male and female slaves.+ + They will take captive those who were their captors, + and rule over those who oppressed them.
3When the Lord has given you rest from your pain and turmoil and the hard service with which you were made to serve, 
4you will take up this + taunt against the king of Babylon:
5The Lord has broken the + staff of the wicked,
6+ that struck the peoples in wrath
7The whole earth is at rest and quiet;
8+ + The cypresses rejoice at you,
9Sheol beneath is stirred up
10+ All of them will answer
11Your pomp is brought down to Sheol,
12“How + you are fallen from heaven,
13You said in your heart,
14I will ascend above the heights of the clouds;
15+ But you are brought down to Sheol,
16Those who see you will stare at you
17who made the world like a desert
18All the kings of the nations lie in glory,
19but you are cast out, away from your grave,
20You will not be joined with them in burial,
21Prepare slaughter for his sons
22“I will rise up against them,” declares the Lord of hosts, “and will cut off from Babylon name and + remnant, + descendants and posterity,” declares the Lord. 
23“And I will make it a possession of the + hedgehog,+  and pools of water, and I will sweep it with the broom of destruction,” declares the Lord of hosts.
24The Lord of hosts has sworn:
25that + I will break the Assyrian in my land,
26This is the purpose that is purposed
27+ For the Lord of hosts has purposed,
28In the year that + King Ahaz died came this + oracle:
29Rejoice not, + O Philistia, all of you,
30And the firstborn of + the poor will graze,
31+ Wail, O + gate; cry out, O city;
32What will one answer the messengers of the nation?
