1O Lord, our Lord,
2+ Out of the mouth of babies and infants,
3When I + look at your heavens, the work of your + fingers,
4+ what is man that you are + mindful of him,
5Yet you have made him a little lower than + the heavenly beings+ 
6You have given him + dominion over the works of your hands;
7all sheep and oxen,
8the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea,
9O Lord, our Lord,
