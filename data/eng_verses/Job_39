1“Do you know when + the mountain goats give birth?
2Can you number the months that they fulfill,
3when they + crouch, bring forth their offspring,
4Their young ones become strong; they grow up in the open;
5“Who has let the wild donkey go free?
6to whom I have given + the arid plain for his home
7He scorns the tumult of the city;
8He ranges the mountains as his pasture,
9“Is + the wild ox willing to serve you?
10Can you bind + him in the furrow with ropes,
11Will you depend on him because his strength is great,
12Do you have faith in him that he will return your grain
13“The wings of the ostrich wave proudly,
14For she leaves her eggs to the earth
15forgetting that a foot may crush them
16She + deals cruelly with her young, as if they were not hers;
17because God has made her forget wisdom
18When she rouses herself to flee,+ 
19“Do you give the horse his might?
20Do you make him leap like the locust?
21He paws+  in the valley and exults in his strength;
22He laughs at fear and is not dismayed;
23Upon him rattle the quiver,
24With fierceness and rage he swallows the ground;
25When the trumpet sounds, he says ‘Aha!’
26“Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars
27Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up
28On the rock he dwells and makes his home,
29From there he spies out the prey;
30His young ones suck up blood,
