1+ I will sing of + the steadfast love of the Lord, forever;
2For I said, + “Steadfast love will be built up forever;
3You have said, “I have made + a covenant with my + chosen one;
4‘I will establish your + offspring forever,
5Let + the heavens praise your + wonders, O Lord,
6For + who in the skies can be compared to the Lord?
7a God greatly + to be feared in the council of + the holy ones,
8O Lord God of hosts,
9You rule the raging of the sea;
10You + crushed + Rahab like a carcass;
11+ The heavens are yours; the earth also is yours;
12+ The north and the south, you have created them;
13You have a mighty arm;
14+ Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne;
15Blessed are the people who know + the festal shout,
16who exult in your + name all the day
17For you are + the glory of their strength;
18For our + shield belongs to the Lord,
19+ Of old you spoke in a vision to your godly one,+  and said:
20+ I have found David, my servant;
21so that my + hand shall be established with him;
22The enemy shall not outwit him;
23I will + crush his foes before him
24My + faithfulness and my + steadfast love shall be with him,
25I will set his hand on + the sea
26He shall cry to me, ‘You are my + Father,
27And I will make him the + firstborn,
28My steadfast love I will keep for him forever,
29I will establish his + offspring forever
30+ If his children forsake my law
31if they violate my statutes
32then I will punish their transgression with + the rod
33but I will not remove from him my steadfast love
34I will not violate my + covenant
35Once for all I have sworn + by my holiness;
36His + offspring shall endure forever,
37Like + the moon it shall be established forever,
38But now you have + cast off and rejected;
39You have + renounced + the covenant with your servant;
40You have + breached all his walls;
41+ All who pass by plunder him;
42You have exalted the right hand of his foes;
43You have also turned back the edge of his sword,
44You have made his splendor to cease
45You have cut short + the days of his youth;
46+ How long, O Lord? Will you hide yourself forever?
47+ Remember + how short my + time is!
48+ What man can live and never + see death?
49Lord, where is your + steadfast love of old,
50+ Remember, O Lord, how your servants are mocked,
51with which your enemies mock, O Lord,
52+ Blessed be the Lord forever!
