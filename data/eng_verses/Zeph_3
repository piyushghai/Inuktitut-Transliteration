1Woe to her who is rebellious and defiled,
2She listens to no voice;
3+ Her officials within her
4+ Her prophets are fickle, treacherous men;
5The Lord within her + is righteous;
6+ “I have cut off nations;
7+ I said, ‘Surely you will fear me;
8“Therefore + wait for me,” declares the Lord,
9“For at that time I will change the speech of the peoples
10+ From beyond the rivers + of Cush
11+ “On that day + you shall not be put to shame
12But I will leave in your midst
13+ those who are left in Israel;
14+ Sing aloud, O daughter of Zion;
15The Lord has taken away the judgments against you;
16+ On that day it shall be said to Jerusalem:
17+ The Lord your God is in your midst,
18I will gather those of you who mourn + for the festival,
19Behold, at that time + I will deal
20+ At that time I will bring you in,
