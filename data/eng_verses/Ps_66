1+ Shout for joy to God, all the earth;
2sing the glory of his name;
3Say to God, + â€œHow awesome are your deeds!
4+ All the earth worships you
5+ Come and see what God has done:
6He + turned the sea into dry land;
7who rules by his might forever,
8Bless our God, O peoples;
9who has kept our soul among the living
10For you, O God, have + tested us;
11You brought us into + the net;
12you let men + ride over our heads;
13I will come into your house with burnt offerings;
14that which my lips uttered
15I will offer to you burnt offerings of fattened animals,
16+ Come and hear, all you who fear God,
17I cried to him with my mouth,
18If I had + cherished iniquity in my heart,
19But truly + God has listened;
20Blessed be God,
