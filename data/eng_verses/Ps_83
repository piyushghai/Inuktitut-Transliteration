1O God, do not keep silence;
2For behold, your enemies + make an uproar;
3They lay + crafty plans against your people;
4They say, “Come, + let us wipe them out as a nation;
5For they conspire with one accord;
6the tents of + Edom and + the Ishmaelites,
7+ Gebal and + Ammon and + Amalek,
8+ Asshur also has joined them;
9Do to them as you did to + Midian,
10who were destroyed at + En-dor,
11Make their nobles like + Oreb and Zeeb,
12who said, + “Let us take possession for ourselves
13O my God, make them like + whirling dust,+ 
14As + fire consumes the forest,
15so may you pursue them + with your tempest
16+ Fill their faces with shame,
17Let them be + put to shame and dismayed forever;
18that they may + know that you alone,
