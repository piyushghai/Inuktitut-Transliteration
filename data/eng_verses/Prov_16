1The plans of the heart belong to man,
2+ All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes,
3+ Commit your work to the Lord,
4+ The Lord has made everything for its purpose,
5Everyone who is arrogant in heart is + an abomination to the Lord;
6By + steadfast love and faithfulness iniquity is atoned for,
7When a man’s ways please the Lord,
8+ Better is a little with righteousness
9+ The heart of man plans his way,
10+ An oracle is on the lips of a king;
11+ A just balance and scales are the Lord’s;
12It is an abomination to kings to do evil,
13+ Righteous lips are the delight of a king,
14+ A king’s wrath is a messenger of death,
15+ In the light of a king’s face there is life,
16+ How much better to get wisdom than + gold!
17The highway of the upright + turns aside from evil;
18+ Pride goes before destruction,
19+ It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor
20Whoever gives thought to the word+ + will discover good,
21The wise of heart is called discerning,
22Good sense is + a fountain of life to him who has it,
23+ The heart of the wise makes his speech judicious
24+ Gracious words are like + a honeycomb,
25There is a way that seems right to a man,
26A worker’s appetite works for him;
27+ A worthless man plots evil,
28+ A dishonest man spreads strife,
29A man of violence + entices his neighbor
30Whoever winks his eyes plans+ + dishonest things;
31+ Gray hair is + a crown of glory;
32+ Whoever is slow to anger is better than the mighty,
33+ The lot is cast into the lap,
