1+ After Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken into exile from Jerusalem + Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, together with + the officials of Judah, the craftsmen, and the metal workers, and had brought them to Babylon, the Lord showed me this vision: behold, + two baskets of figs placed before the temple of the Lord. 
2One basket had very good figs, + like first-ripe figs, but the other basket had + very bad figs, so bad that they could not be eaten. 
3And the Lord said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” I said, “Figs, the good figs very good, and the bad figs very bad, so bad that they cannot be eaten.”
4Then the word of the Lord came to me: 
5“Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so I will regard as good the exiles from Judah, + whom I have sent away from this place to the land of the Chaldeans. 
6+ I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them back to this land. + I will build them up, and not tear them down; + I will plant them, and not pluck them up. 
7+ I will give them a heart to know that I am the Lord, + and they shall be my people + and I will be their God, + for they shall return to me with their whole heart.
8“But thus says the Lord: Like + the bad figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten, so will I treat + Zedekiah the king of Judah, his officials, the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and those who + dwell in the land of Egypt. 
9I will make them + a horror+  to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be + a reproach, + a byword, + a taunt, and + a curse in all the places where I shall drive them. 
10And I will send + sword, famine, and pestilence upon them, until they shall be utterly destroyed from the land that I gave to them and their fathers.”
