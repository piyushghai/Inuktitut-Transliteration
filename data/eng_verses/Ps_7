1O Lord my God, in you do I + take refuge;
2lest like + a lion they tear my soul apart,
3O Lord my God, + if I have done this,
4if I have repaid + my friend+  with evil
5let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake it,
6+ Arise, O Lord, in your anger;
7Let the assembly of the peoples be gathered about you;
8The Lord+ judges the peoples;
9Oh, let the evil of the wicked come to an end,
10My shield is + with God,
11God is + a righteous judge,
12If a man+  does not repent, God+  will + whet his sword;
13he has prepared for him his deadly weapons,
14Behold, the wicked man + conceives evil
15He makes + a pit, digging it out,
16His + mischief returns upon his own head,
17I will give to the Lord the thanks due to his righteousness,
