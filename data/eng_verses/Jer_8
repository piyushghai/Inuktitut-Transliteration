1“At that time, declares the Lord, the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of its officials, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be brought out of their tombs. 
2And they shall be spread + before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven, which they have loved and served, which they have gone after, and which they have sought and worshiped. + And they shall not be gathered or buried. + They shall be as dung on the surface of the ground. 
3+ Death shall be preferred to life by all the remnant that remains of this evil family + in all the places where I have driven them, declares the Lord of hosts.
4“You shall say to them, Thus says the Lord:
5Why then has this people + turned away
6+ I have paid attention and listened,
7Even the stork in the heavens
8+ “How can you say, ‘We are wise,
9+ The wise men shall be put to shame;
10+ Therefore I will give their wives to others
11They have healed + the wound of my people lightly,
12Were they ashamed when they committed abomination?
13When I would gather them, declares the Lord,
14Why do we sit still?
15+ We looked for peace, but no good came;
16+ “The snorting of their horses is heard + from Dan;
17For behold, I am sending among you + serpents,
18My joy is gone; grief is upon me;+ 
19Behold, the cry of the daughter of my people
20“The harvest is past, the summer is ended,
21For the wound of + the daughter of my people is my heart wounded;
22Is there no + balm in Gilead?
