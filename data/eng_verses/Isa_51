1+ “Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness,
2Look to Abraham your father
3For the Lord+ comforts Zion;
4+ “Give attention to me, my people,
5+ My righteousness draws near,
6+ Lift up your eyes to the heavens,
7+ “Listen to me, you who know righteousness,
8+ For the moth will eat them up like a garment,
9+ Awake, awake, + put on strength,
10+ Was it not you who dried up the sea,
11+ And the ransomed of the Lord shall return
12“I, I am he + who comforts you;
13and have forgotten the Lord, your Maker,
14+ He who is bowed down shall speedily be released;
15I am the Lord your God,
16+ And I have put my words in your mouth
17+ Wake yourself, wake yourself,
18+ There is none to guide her
19+ These two things have happened to you—
20+ Your sons have fainted;
21+ Therefore hear this, you who are afflicted,
22Thus says your Lord, the Lord,
23+ and I will put it into the hand of your tormentors,
