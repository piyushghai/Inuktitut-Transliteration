1+ Incline your ear, O Lord, and answer me,
2Preserve my life, for I am + godly;
3+ Be gracious to me, O Lord,
4Gladden the soul of your servant,
5For you, O Lord, are good and + forgiving,
6+ Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer;
7In + the day of my trouble I call upon you,
8There is + none like you among the gods, O Lord,
9+ All the nations you have made shall come
10For + you are great and + do wondrous things;
11+ Teach me your way, O Lord,
12I give thanks to you, O Lord my God, with my whole heart,
13+ For great is your steadfast love toward me;
14O God, insolent men have + risen up against me;
15But you, O Lord, are a God + merciful and gracious,
16+ Turn to me and be gracious to me;
17+ Show me a sign of your + favor,
