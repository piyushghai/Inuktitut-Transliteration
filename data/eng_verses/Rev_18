1After this I saw + another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and + the earth was made bright with his glory. 
2And he called out with a mighty voice,
3For all nations have drunk+ 
4Then I heard another voice from heaven saying,
5for + her sins are heaped high as heaven,
6+ Pay her back as she herself has paid back others,
7+ As she glorified herself and lived in luxury,
8For this reason her plagues will come + in a single day,
9And + the kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality and lived in luxury with her, + will weep and wail over her + when they see the smoke of her burning. 
10+ They will stand far off, in fear of her torment, and say,
11And + the merchants of the earth weep and mourn for her, since no one buys their cargo anymore, 
12cargo of gold, silver, jewels, pearls, fine linen, purple cloth, silk, scarlet cloth, all kinds of scented wood, all kinds of articles of ivory, all kinds of articles of costly wood, bronze, iron and marble, 
13cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle and sheep, horses and chariots, and slaves, that is, human souls.+ 
14“The fruit for which your soul longed
15+ The merchants of these wares, who gained wealth from her, + will stand far off, in fear of her torment, weeping and mourning aloud,
16“Alas, alas, for the great city
17For + in a single hour all this wealth + has been laid waste.”
18and + cried out + as they saw the smoke of her burning,
19And they threw + dust on their heads as they wept and mourned, crying out,
20+ Rejoice over her, O heaven,
21Then + a mighty angel + took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying,
22and + the sound of harpists and musicians, of flute players and trumpeters,
23and the light of a lamp
24And + in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints,
