1Likewise, wives, + be subject to your own husbands, so that + even if some do not obey the word, + they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives, 
2when they see your + respectful and pure conduct. 
3+ Do not let your adorning be external—the braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry, or the clothing you wear— 
4but let your adorning be + the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God’s sight is very precious. 
5For this is how the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves, by submitting to their own husbands, 
6as Sarah obeyed Abraham, + calling him lord. And you are her children, if you do good and + do not fear anything that is frightening.
7Likewise, + husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker + vessel, since they are heirs with you+  of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.
8Finally, all of you, + have unity of mind, sympathy, + brotherly love, + a tender heart, and + a humble mind. 
9+ Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, + bless, for + to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing. 
10For
11let him turn away from evil and do good;
12For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,
13Now + who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good? 
14+ But even if you should suffer for righteousness’ sake, you will be blessed. + Have no fear of them, + nor be troubled, 
15but + in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, + always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and + respect, 
16+ having a good conscience, so that, + when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame. 
17For + it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God’s will, than for doing evil.
18For Christ also + suffered+ + once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, + that he might bring us to God, being put to death + in the flesh but made alive + in the spirit, 
19in which+  he went and + proclaimed+  to the spirits in prison, 
20because+  they formerly did not obey, + when God’s patience waited in the days of Noah, + while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, + eight persons, were brought safely through water. 
21Baptism, which corresponds to this, + now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but + as an appeal to God for a good conscience, + through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 
22who has gone into heaven and + is at the right hand of God, + with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.
