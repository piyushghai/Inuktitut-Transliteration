1An + oracle concerning + Damascus.
2The cities of + Aroer are deserted;
3The fortress will disappear from + Ephraim,
4And in that day + the glory of Jacob will be brought low,
5And it shall be + as when the reaper gathers standing grain
6+ Gleanings will be left in it,
7+ In that day man will look to his Maker, and his eyes will look on the Holy One of Israel. 
8+ He will not look to the altars, the work of his hands, and he will not look on what his own fingers have made, either the + Asherim or the altars of incense.
9+ In that day their strong cities will be like the deserted places of the wooded heights and the hilltops, which they deserted because of the children of Israel, and there will be desolation.
10For + you have forgotten the God of your salvation
11though you make them grow+  on the day that you plant them,
12Ah, + the thunder of many peoples;
13+ The nations roar like the roaring of many waters,
14+ At evening time, behold, terror!
