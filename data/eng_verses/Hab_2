1I will + take my stand at my watchpost
2And the Lord answered me:
3For still + the vision awaits its appointed time;
4“Behold, his soul is puffed up; it is not upright within him,
5“Moreover, wine+  is + a traitor,
6Shall not all these + take up their taunt against him, with scoffing and riddles for him, and say,
7+ Will not your debtors suddenly arise,
8+ Because you have plundered many nations,
9+ “Woe to him who gets evil gain for his house,
10You have devised shame for your house
11For + the stone will cry out from the wall,
12+ “Woe to him + who builds a town with blood
13Behold, is it not from the Lord of hosts
14+ For the earth will be filled
15+ “Woe to him + who makes his neighbors drink—
16You will have your fill + of shame instead of glory.
17+ The violence + done to Lebanon will overwhelm you,
18+ “What profit is an idol
19+ Woe to him + who says to a wooden thing, Awake;
20But + the Lord is in his holy temple;
