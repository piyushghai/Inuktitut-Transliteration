1In that day + this song will be sung in the land of Judah:
2+ Open the gates,
3+ You keep him in perfect peace
4Trust in the Lord forever,
5+ For he has humbled
6The foot tramples it,
7The path of the righteous is level;
8In the path of your judgments,
9My soul yearns for you in the night;
10+ If favor is shown to the wicked,
11O Lord, + your hand is lifted up,
12O Lord, you will ordain + peace for us,
13O Lord our God,
14They are dead, they will not live;
15+ But you have increased the nation, O Lord,
16O Lord, + in distress they sought you;
17+ Like a pregnant woman
18+ we were pregnant, we writhed,
19+ Your dead shall live; their bodies shall rise.
20Come, my people, enter your chambers,
21+ For behold, the Lord is coming out from his place
