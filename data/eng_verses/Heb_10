1For since the law has but + a shadow + of the good things to come instead of the true form of these realities, + it can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered every year, make perfect those who draw near. 
2Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have any consciousness of sins? 
3But + in these sacrifices + there is a reminder of sins every year. 
4For + it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
5Consequently, + when Christ+  came into the world, he said,
6in burnt offerings and sin offerings
7Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come to do your will, O God,
8When he said above, “You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in + sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings” (these are offered according to the law), 
9then he added, + “Behold, I have come to do your will.” He does away with the first in order to establish the second. 
10And by that will + we have been sanctified through the offering of + the body of Jesus Christ + once for all.
11And every priest stands + daily at his service, + offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, + which can never take away sins. 
12But when Christ+  had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he + sat down at the right hand of God, 
13waiting from that time + until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet. 
14For by a single offering + he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.
15And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying,
16+ “This is the covenant that I will make with them
17then he adds,
18Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.
19+ Therefore, brothers,+  since we have confidence to enter + the holy places by the blood of Jesus, 
20by + the new and living way that he opened for us through + the curtain, that is, through his flesh, 
21and since we have + a great priest over the house of God, 
22let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts + sprinkled clean + from an evil conscience and our bodies + washed with pure water. 
23+ Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for + he who promised is faithful. 
24And + let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, 
25+ not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and + all the more as you see + the Day drawing near.
26For + if we go on sinning deliberately + after receiving the knowledge of the truth, + there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, 
27+ but a fearful expectation of judgment, and + a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries. 
28+ Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy + on the evidence of two or three witnesses. 
29How much worse punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the one + who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has profaned + the blood of the covenant + by which he was sanctified, and has + outraged the Spirit of grace? 
30For we know him who said, + “Vengeance is mine; I will repay.” And again, + “The Lord will judge his people.” 
31+ It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
32But recall the former days when, after + you were enlightened, you endured + a hard struggle with sufferings, 
33sometimes being + publicly exposed to reproach and affliction, and sometimes being partners with those so treated. 
34For + you had compassion on those in prison, and + you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had + a better possession and an abiding one. 
35Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has + a great reward. 
36For + you have need of endurance, so that + when you have done the will of God you may + receive what is promised. 
37For,
38+ but my righteous one shall live by faith,
39But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls.
