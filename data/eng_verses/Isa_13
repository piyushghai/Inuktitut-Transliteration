1The oracle concerning + Babylon which + Isaiah the son of Amoz saw.
2On a bare hill + raise a signal;
3I myself have commanded my consecrated ones,
4The sound + of a tumult is on the mountains
5+ They come from a distant land,
6+ Wail, for + the day of the Lord is near;
7Therefore all hands will be feeble,
8They will be dismayed:
9Behold, + the day of the Lord comes,
10+ For the stars of the heavens and their constellations
11I will punish + the world for its evil,
12I will make + people more rare than fine gold,
13Therefore + I will make the heavens tremble,
14And like a hunted gazelle,
15Whoever is found will be thrust through,
16+ Their infants will be dashed in pieces
17Behold, + I am stirring up the Medes against them,
18+ Their bows will slaughter+  the young men;
19And Babylon, + the glory of kingdoms,
20+ It will never be inhabited
21But + wild animals will lie down there,
22Hyenas+  will cry in its towers,
