1And you, + take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel, 
2and say:
3And she brought up one of her cubs;
4The nations heard about him;
5When she saw that she waited in vain,
6He prowled among the lions;
7and seized+  their widows.
8+ Then the nations set against him
9With hooks + they put him in a cage+ 
10Your mother was + like a vine in a vineyard+ 
11Its strong stems became
12But the vine was plucked up in fury,
13+ Now it is planted in the wilderness,
14+ And fire has gone out from the stem of its shoots,
