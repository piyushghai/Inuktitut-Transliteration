1+ Then Jacob called his sons and said, “Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you what shall happen to you + in days to come.
2“Assemble and listen, O sons of Jacob,
3“Reuben, you are + my firstborn,
4Unstable as water, you shall not have preeminence,
5+ “Simeon and Levi are brothers;
6Let my soul come not into their council;
7Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce,
8“Judah, + your brothers shall praise you;
9Judah is + a lion’s cub;
10The + scepter shall not depart from Judah,
11Binding his foal to the vine
12His + eyes are darker than wine,
13+ “Zebulun shall dwell at the + shore of the sea;
14+ “Issachar is a strong donkey,
15He saw that a resting place was good,
16+ “Dan shall + judge his people
17Dan + shall be a serpent in the way,
18I + wait for your salvation, O Lord.
19+ “Raiders shall raid + Gad,+ 
20+ “Asher’s food shall be rich,
21+ “Naphtali is a doe let loose
22“Joseph is + a fruitful bough,
23The archers + bitterly attacked him,
24yet + his bow remained unmoved;
25+ by the God of your father who will help you,
26The blessings of your father
27+ “Benjamin is a ravenous wolf,
28All these are the twelve tribes of Israel. This is what their father said to them as he blessed them, blessing each with the blessing suitable to him. 
29Then he commanded them and said to them, “I am to be + gathered to my people; + bury me with my fathers + in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 
30in the cave that is in the field at Machpelah, to the east of Mamre, in the land of Canaan, + which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess as a burying place. 
31+ There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife. There + they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried Leah— 
32the field and the cave that is in it were bought from the Hittites.” 
33When Jacob finished commanding his sons, he drew up his feet into the bed and breathed his last and + was gathered to his people.
