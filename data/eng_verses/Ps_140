1+ Deliver me, O Lord, from evil men;
2who plan evil things in their heart
3They make + their tongue sharp as + a serpentâ€™s,
4Guard me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked;
5The arrogant have + hidden a trap for me,
6+ I say to the Lord, You are my God;
7O Lord, my Lord, + the strength of my salvation,
8+ Grant not, O Lord, the desires of the wicked;
9As for the head of those who surround me,
10Let + burning coals fall upon them!
11Let not the slanderer be established in the land;
12I know that the Lord will + maintain the cause of the afflicted,
13Surely + the righteous shall give thanks to your name;
