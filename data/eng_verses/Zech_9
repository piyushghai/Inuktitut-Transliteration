1The oracle of the word of the Lord is against the land of Hadrach
2+ and on Hamath also, which borders on it,
3Tyre has built herself + a rampart
4But behold, the Lord will strip her of her possessions
5+ Ashkelon shall see it, and be afraid;
6+ a mixed people+  shall dwell in Ashdod,
7I will take away + its blood from its mouth,
8Then + I will encamp at my house as a guard,
9+ Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion!
10+ I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim
11As for you also, because of + the blood of my covenant with you,
12Return to your stronghold, O + prisoners of hope;
13For + I have bent Judah as my bow;
14Then the Lord will appear over them,
15The Lord of hosts + will protect them,
16On that day the Lord their God will save them,
17+ For how great is his goodness, and how great his beauty!
