1+ And as soon as it was morning, the chief priests + held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council. And + they bound Jesus and + led him away and + delivered him over to + Pilate. 
2+ And Pilate asked him, + “Are you the King of the Jews?” And he answered him, + “You have said so.” 
3And the chief priests accused him of many things. 
4And Pilate again asked him, + “Have you no answer to make? See how many charges they bring against you.” 
5But Jesus + made no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed.
6+ Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner for whom they asked. 
7And among the rebels in prison, who had + committed murder + in the insurrection, there was a man called Barabbas. 
8And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he usually did for them. 
9And he answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?” 
10For he perceived that + it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up. 
11But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead. 
12And Pilate again said to them, “Then what shall I do with + the man you call the King of the Jews?” 
13And they cried out again, “Crucify him.” 
14And Pilate said to them, “Why, + what evil has he done?” But they shouted all the more, “Crucify him.” 
15So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released for them Barabbas, and having + scourged+  Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.
16+ And the soldiers led him away inside + the palace (that is, + the governor’s headquarters),+  and they called together the whole + battalion.+ 
17And they clothed him in + a purple cloak, and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on him. 
18And they began to salute him, + “Hail, King of the Jews!” 
19And they were striking his head with a reed and + spitting on him and + kneeling down in homage to him. 
20And when they had + mocked him, they stripped him of + the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him. And they + led him out to crucify him.
21+ And they compelled a passerby, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross. 
22+ And they brought him to the place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull). 
23And they offered him wine mixed with + myrrh, but he did not take it. 
24And they crucified him and + divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take. 
25And + it was the third hour+  when they crucified him. 
26And the inscription of the charge against him read, + “The King of the Jews.” 
27And with him they crucified two + robbers, + one on his right and one on his left.+ 
29And + those who passed by derided him, + wagging their heads and saying, + “Aha! + You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, 
30save yourself, and come down from the cross!” 
31So also the chief priests with the scribes mocked him to one another, saying, + “He saved others; + he cannot save himself. 
32Let + the Christ, + the King of Israel, come down now from the cross that we may + see and believe.” + Those who were crucified with him also reviled him.
33And when the sixth hour+  had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.+ 
34And at the ninth hour Jesus + cried with a loud voice, + “Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?” which means, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” 
35And some of the bystanders hearing it said, “Behold, he is calling Elijah.” 
36And someone ran and filled a sponge with + sour wine, put it on a reed + and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.” 
37And Jesus + uttered a loud cry and + breathed his last. 
38And + the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. 
39+ And when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that in this way he+  breathed his last, he said, + “Truly this man was the Son+  of God!”
40There were also + women looking on + from a distance, among whom were + Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and + Salome. 
41When he was in Galilee, they followed him and + ministered to him, and there were also many other women who + came up with him to Jerusalem.
42+ And when evening had come, since it was + the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath, 
43Joseph of Arimathea, + a respected member of the council, who + was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, took courage and went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 
44Pilate was surprised to hear that he should have already died.+  And summoning + the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead. 
45And when he learned from + the centurion that he was dead, he granted the corpse to Joseph. 
46And Joseph+  bought + a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud and + laid him in a tomb + that had been cut out of the rock. And he rolled + a stone against the entrance of the tomb. 
47+ Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.
