1+  “For behold, + in those days and at that time, when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem, 
2+ I will gather all the nations and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. And + I will enter into judgment with them there, on behalf of my people and my heritage Israel, because they have scattered them among the nations and have divided up my land, 
3and + have cast lots for my people, and have traded a boy for a prostitute, and have sold a girl for wine and have drunk it.
4“What are you to me, + O Tyre and Sidon, and all + the regions of Philistia? Are you paying me back for something? If you are paying me back, + I will return your payment on your own head swiftly and speedily. 
5For + you have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried my rich treasures into your temples.+ 
6You have sold + the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks in order to remove them far from their own border. 
7Behold, I will stir them up from the place to which you have sold them, and + I will return your payment on your own head. 
8I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the + Sabeans, to a nation far away, for the Lord has spoken.”
9Proclaim this among the nations:
10+ Beat your plowshares into swords,
11+ Hasten and come,
12Let the nations stir themselves up
13+ Put in the sickle,
14Multitudes, multitudes,
15+ The sun and the moon are darkened,
16+ The Lord roars from Zion,
17+ “So you shall know that I am the Lord your God,
18“And in that day
19+ “Egypt shall become a desolation
20+ But Judah shall be inhabited forever,
21+ I will avenge their blood,
