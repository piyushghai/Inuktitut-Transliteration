1+ My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
2O my God, I cry by + day, but you do not answer,
3Yet you are + holy,
4In you our fathers trusted;
5To you they + cried and were rescued;
6But I am + a worm and not a man,
7All who see me + mock me;
8+ “He trusts in the Lord; let him + deliver him;
9Yet you are he who + took me from the womb;
10On you was I cast from my birth,
11Be not + far from me,
12Many bulls encompass me;
13they + open wide their mouths at me,
14I am + poured out like water,
15my strength is + dried up like a potsherd,
16For + dogs encompass me;
17I can count all my bones—
18+ they divide my garments among them,
19But you, O Lord, + do not be far off!
20Deliver my soul from the sword,
21Save me from + the mouth of the lion!
22+ I will tell of your name to my + brothers;
23You who + fear the Lord, praise him!
24For he has not despised or abhorred
25From you comes my praise in the great + congregation;
26+ The afflicted+  shall + eat and be satisfied;
27All + the ends of the earth shall remember
28For + kingship belongs to the Lord,
29All + the prosperous of the earth eat and worship;
30Posterity shall serve him;
31they shall + come and proclaim his righteousness to a people yet + unborn,
