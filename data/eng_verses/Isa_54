1+ “Sing, O barren one, who did not bear;
2+ “Enlarge the place of your tent,
3+ For you will spread abroad to the right and to the left,
4“Fear not, + for you will not be ashamed;
5+ For your Maker is your husband,
6+ For the Lord has called you
7+ For a brief moment I deserted you,
8+ In overflowing anger for a moment
9“This is like + the days of Noah+  to me:
10For the mountains may depart
11+ “O afflicted one, storm-tossed and not comforted,
12I will make your pinnacles of agate,+ 
13+ All your children + shall be taught by the Lord,
14In righteousness you shall be established;
15+ If anyone stirs up strife,
16Behold, I have created the smith
17no weapon that is fashioned against you shall succeed,
