1Open your doors, + O Lebanon,
2Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen,
3The sound of + the wail of + the shepherds,
4Thus said the Lord my God: + “Become shepherd of the flock doomed to slaughter. 
5+ Those who buy them slaughter them and go unpunished, and those who sell them say, ‘Blessed be the Lord, + I have become rich,’ and their own shepherds have no pity on them. 
6For + I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of this land, declares the Lord. Behold, I will cause each of them to fall into the hand of his neighbor, and each into the hand of his king, and they shall crush the land, and I will deliver none from their hand.”

13Then the Lord said to me, “Throw it to the potter”—+ the lordly price at which I was priced by them. So I took the + thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the Lord, to the potter. 
14Then I broke + my second staff Union, annulling the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
15Then the Lord said to me, “Take once more the equipment of + a foolish shepherd. 
16For behold, I am raising up in the land a shepherd + who does not care for those being destroyed, or seek the young or heal the maimed or nourish the healthy, but + devours the flesh of the fat ones, tearing off even their hoofs.
17+ “Woe to my worthless shepherd,
