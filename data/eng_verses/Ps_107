1+ Oh give thanks to the Lord, + for he is good,
2Let + the redeemed of the Lord say so,
3and + gathered in from the lands,
4Some + wandered in desert wastes,
5hungry and thirsty,
6Then they + cried to the Lord in their trouble,
7He led them by + a straight way
8+ Let them thank the Lord for his steadfast love,
9For he + satisfies the longing soul,
10+ Some sat in darkness and in + the shadow of death,
11for they + had rebelled against the words of God,
12So he bowed their hearts down with hard labor;
13+ Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble,
14He brought them out of + darkness and the shadow of death,
15+ Let them thank the Lord for his steadfast love,
16For he + shatters the doors of bronze
17Some were + fools through their sinful ways,
18+ they loathed any kind of food,
19+ Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble,
20He + sent out his word and + healed them,
21+ Let them thank the Lord for his steadfast love,
22And let them + offer sacrifices of thanksgiving,
23Some + went down to the sea in ships,
24they saw the deeds of the Lord,
25For he + commanded and + raised the stormy wind,
26They mounted up to heaven; they went down to the depths;
27they reeled and + staggered like drunken men
28+ Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble,
29He + made the storm be still,
30Then they were glad that the waters+  were quiet,
31+ Let them thank the Lord for his steadfast love,
32Let them + extol him in + the congregation of the people,
33He + turns rivers into a desert,
34+ a fruitful land into a salty waste,
35He + turns a desert into pools of water,
36And there he lets the hungry dwell,
37they sow fields and plant vineyards
38+ By his blessing they multiply greatly,
39When they are diminished and brought low
40+ he pours contempt on princes
41but + he raises up the needy out of affliction
42+ The upright see it and are glad,
43+ Whoever is wise, let him attend to these things;
