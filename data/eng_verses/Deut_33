1This is the blessing with which Moses + the man of God blessed the people of Israel before his death. 
2He said,
3Yes, + he loved his people,+ 
4when + Moses commanded us a law,
5Thus the Lord+ + became king in + Jeshurun,
6+ “Let Reuben live, and not die,
7And this he said of Judah:
8And + of Levi he said,
9who said of his father and mother,
10+ They shall teach Jacob your rules
11Bless, O Lord, his substance,
12+ Of Benjamin he said,
13And + of Joseph he said,
14with the choicest fruits of the sun
15with the finest produce of the ancient mountains
16with the best gifts of the earth and + its fullness
17+ A firstborn bull+ —he has majesty,
18And of Zebulun he said,
19They shall call peoples + to their mountain;
20And + of Gad he said,
21+ He chose the best of the land for himself,
22And + of Dan he said,
23And + of Naphtali he said,
24And + of Asher he said,
25Your bars shall be iron and bronze,
26+ “There is none like God, O + Jeshurun,
27The eternal God is your + dwelling place,+ 
28So Israel lived in safety,
29Happy are you, O Israel! + Who is like you,
