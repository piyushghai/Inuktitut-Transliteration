1+ Have mercy on me,+  O God,
2+ Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity,
3+ For I know my transgressions,
4+ Against you, you only, have I sinned
5Behold, + I was brought forth in iniquity,
6Behold, you delight in truth in + the inward being,
7Purge me + with hyssop, and I shall be clean;
8Let me hear joy and gladness;
9+ Hide your face from my sins,
10+ Create in me a + clean heart, O God,
11+ Cast me not away from your presence,
12Restore to me the joy of your salvation,
13Then I will teach transgressors your ways,
14Deliver me from + bloodguiltiness, O God,
15O Lord, open my lips,
16+ For you will not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it;
17The sacrifices of God are + a broken spirit;
18+ Do good to Zion in your good pleasure;
19then will you delight in + right sacrifices,
