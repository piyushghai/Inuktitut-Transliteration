1+ He who is often reproved, yet stiffens his neck,
2When + the righteous increase, the people rejoice,
3He who + loves wisdom makes his father glad,
4By justice a king + builds up the land,
5+ A man who flatters his neighbor
6An evil man is + ensnared in his transgression,
7A righteous man + knows the rights of the poor;
8+ Scoffers set a city aflame,
9If a wise man has an argument with a fool,
10Bloodthirsty men + hate one who is blameless
11A fool gives full vent to his spirit,
12If a ruler listens to falsehood,
13The poor man and the oppressor + meet together;
14If a king + faithfully judges the poor,
15+ The rod and reproof give wisdom,
16When the wicked increase, transgression increases,
17+ Discipline your son, and he will give you rest;
18Where + there is no prophetic vision the people + cast off restraint,+ 
19By mere words a servant is not disciplined,
20Do you see a man who is hasty in his words?
21Whoever pampers his servant from childhood
22+ A man of wrath stirs up strife,
23+ Oneâ€™s pride will bring him low,
24The partner of a thief + hates his own life;
25+ The fear of man lays a snare,
26Many + seek the face of a ruler,
27+ An unjust man is an abomination to the righteous,
