1Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things that + have been accomplished among us, 
2+ just as those who + from the beginning were + eyewitnesses and + ministers of + the word + have delivered them to us, 
3it seemed good to me also, having followed all things closely for some time past, to write + an orderly account for you, + most excellent + Theophilus, 
4that you may have + certainty concerning the things + you have been taught.
5+ In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah,+ + of + the division of Abijah. And he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. 
6And they were both + righteous before God, walking + blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord. 
7But they had no child, because + Elizabeth was barren, and + both were advanced in years.
8Now + while he was serving as priest before God when + his division was on duty, 
9according to the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot + to enter + the temple of the Lord and burn incense. 
10And the whole multitude of the people + were praying + outside at the hour of incense. 
11And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of + the altar of incense. 
12And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and + fear fell upon him. 
13But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for + your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and + you shall call his name John. 
14And you will have joy and gladness, and many will + rejoice at his birth, 
15for he will be + great before the Lord. And + he must not drink wine or strong + drink, and + he will be + filled with the Holy Spirit, + even from his mother’s womb. 
16And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God, 
17and + he will go before him + in the spirit and power of Elijah, + to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and + the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, + to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.”
18And Zechariah said to the angel, + “How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.” 
19And the angel answered him, “I am + Gabriel. + I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. 
20And behold, + you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.” 
21And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they were wondering at his delay in + the temple. 
22And when he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in + the temple. And + he kept making signs to them and remained mute. 
23And + when his time of + service was ended, he went to his home.
24After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she kept herself hidden, saying, 
25“Thus the Lord has done for me in the days when he looked on me, + to take away my reproach among people.”
26In the sixth month the angel + Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named + Nazareth, 
27+ to a virgin betrothed+  to a man whose name was Joseph, + of the house of David. And the virgin’s name was Mary. 
28And he came to her and said, “Greetings, + O favored one, + the Lord is with you!”+ 
29But + she was greatly troubled at the saying, and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be. 
30And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for + you have found favor with God. 
31And behold, + you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and + you shall call his name Jesus. 
32He will be great and will be called the Son of + the Most High. And the Lord God + will give to him the throne of + his father David, 
33and he will reign over the house of Jacob + forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.”
34And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I am a virgin?”+ 
35And the angel answered her, + “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of + the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born+  will be called + holy—+ the Son of God. 
36And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month with her + who was called barren. 
37For + nothing will be impossible with God.” 
38And Mary said, “Behold, I am the servant+  of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.” And + the angel departed from her.
39In those days Mary arose and went with haste into + the hill country, to a town in Judah, 
40and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. 
41And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth + was filled with the Holy Spirit, 
42and she exclaimed with a loud cry, + “Blessed are you among women, and + blessed is + the fruit of your womb! 
43And why is this granted to me that the mother of + my Lord should come to me? 
44For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. 
45And + blessed is she who believed that there would be+  a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.”
46And Mary said,
47+ and my + spirit rejoices in + God my Savior,
48for + he has looked on the humble estate of his servant.
49for + he who is mighty + has done great things for me,
50And + his mercy is for those who fear him
51+ He has shown strength with his arm;
52+ he has brought down the mighty from their thrones
53he has filled + the hungry with good things,
54He has + helped + his servant Israel,
55+ as he spoke to our fathers,
56And Mary remained with her about three months and returned to her home.
57Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son. 
58And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord + had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her. 
59And + on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child. And they would have called him Zechariah after his father, 
60but his mother answered, “No; + he shall be called John.” 
61And they said to her, “None of your relatives is called by this name.” 
62And + they made signs to his father, inquiring what he wanted him to be called. 
63And he asked for + a writing tablet and wrote, + “His name is John.” And they all wondered. 
64+ And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue + loosed, and he spoke, + blessing God. 
65And + fear came on all their neighbors. And all these things were talked about through all + the hill country of Judea, 
66and all who heard them + laid them up in their hearts, saying, “What then will this child be?” For + the hand of the Lord was with him.
67And his father Zechariah + was filled with the Holy Spirit and + prophesied, saying,
68+ “Blessed be the Lord + God of Israel,
69and + has raised up + a horn of salvation for us
70+ as + he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old,
71+ that we should be saved from our enemies
72+ to show the mercy promised to our fathers
73+ the oath that he swore to our father Abraham, to grant us
74that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies,
75+ in holiness and righteousness before him + all our days.
76And you, child, will be called + the prophet of + the Most High;
77to give knowledge of salvation to his people
78because of the + tender mercy of our God,
79to + give light to + those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,
80+ And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was + in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel.
