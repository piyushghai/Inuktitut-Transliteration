1The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord: 
2“Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: + Write in a book all the words that I have spoken to you. 
3+ For behold, days are coming, declares the Lord, + when I will restore + the fortunes of my people, + Israel and Judah, says the Lord, + and I will bring them back to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall take possession of it.”
4These are the words that the Lord spoke concerning + Israel and Judah:
5“Thus says the Lord:
6Ask now, and see,
7Alas! + That day is so great
8“And it shall come to pass in that day, declares the Lord of hosts, that I will + break his + yoke from off your neck, and I will + burst your bonds, + and foreigners shall no more make a servant of him.+ 
9But they shall serve the Lord their God and + David their king, whom I will raise up for them.
10+ “Then fear not, + O Jacob my servant, declares the Lord,
11+ For I am with you to save you,
12“For thus says the Lord:
13There is none to uphold your cause,
14+ All your lovers have forgotten you;
15+ Why do you cry out over your hurt?
16+ Therefore all who devour you shall be devoured,
17+ For I will restore + health to you,
18“Thus says the Lord:
19+ Out of them shall come songs of thanksgiving,
20+ Their children shall be as they were of old,
21+ Their prince shall be one of themselves;
22+ And you shall be my people,
23+ Behold + the storm of the Lord!
24+ The fierce anger of the Lord will not turn back
