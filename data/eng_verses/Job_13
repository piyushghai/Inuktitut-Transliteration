1“Behold, my eye has seen all this,
2+ What you know, I also know;
3+ But I would speak to the Almighty,
4As for you, + you whitewash with lies;
5Oh that you would + keep silent,
6Hear now my argument
7Will you + speak falsely for God
8Will you show partiality toward him?
9Will it be well with you when he + searches you out?
10He will surely rebuke you
11Will not his + majesty terrify you,
12Your maxims are proverbs of + ashes;
13“Let me have silence, and I will speak,
14Why should I take my flesh in my teeth
15+ Though he slay me, I will + hope in him;+ 
16This will be my salvation,
17+ Keep listening to my words,
18Behold, I have + prepared my case;
19+ Who is there who will contend with me?
20Only grant me two things,
21+ withdraw your hand far from me,
22+ Then call, and I will answer;
23How many are my iniquities and my sins?
24Why + do you hide your face
25Will you frighten + a driven leaf
26For you + write bitter things against me
27You put my feet in + the stocks
28Man+  wastes away like + a rotten thing,
