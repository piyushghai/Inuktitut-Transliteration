1Thus says the Lord: “Go down to the house of the king of Judah and speak there this word, 
2and say, + ‘Hear the word of the Lord, O king of Judah, who sits on the throne of David, you, and your servants, and your people who enter these gates. 
3Thus says the Lord: + Do justice and righteousness, and deliver from the hand of the oppressor him who has been robbed. And + do no wrong or violence + to the resident alien, + the fatherless, and the widow, nor + shed innocent blood in this place. 
4For if you will indeed obey this word, + then there shall enter the gates of this house kings who sit on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their servants and their people. 
5But if you will not obey these words, I + swear by myself, declares the Lord, that + this house shall become a desolation. 
6For thus says the Lord concerning the house of the king of Judah:
7+ I will prepare destroyers against you,
8“‘And many nations will pass by this city, and every man will say to his neighbor, + “Why has the Lord dealt thus with this great city?” 
9+ And they will answer, “Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord their God and worshiped other gods and served them.”’”
10+ Weep not for him who is dead,
11For thus says the Lord concerning Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, and + who went away from this place: “He shall return here no more, 
12but + in the place where they have carried him captive, there shall he die, and he shall never see this land again.”
13+ “Woe to him who builds his house by + unrighteousness,
14who says, ‘I will build myself a great house
15Do you think you are a king
16+ He judged the cause of the poor and needy;
17But you have eyes and heart
18Therefore thus says the Lord concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:
19With the burial of a donkey + he shall be buried,
20“Go up to Lebanon, and cry out,
21I spoke to you in your prosperity,
22+ The wind shall shepherd all your shepherds,
23O inhabitant of + Lebanon,
24+ “As I live, declares the Lord, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were + the signet ring on my right hand, yet I would tear you off 
25and + give you + into the hand of those who seek your life, into the hand of those of whom you are afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeans. 
26+ I will hurl you and + the mother who bore you into another country, where you were not born, and there you shall die. 
27But to the land to which they will long to return, there they shall not return.”
28Is this man + Coniah a despised, broken pot,
29+ O land, land, land,
30Thus says the Lord:
