1The word of the Lord that came to Micah + of Moresheth + in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw + concerning + Samaria and Jerusalem.
2+ Hear, you peoples, all of you;+ 
3For behold, + the Lord is coming out of + his place,
4And + the mountains will melt under him,
5All this is for + the transgression of Jacob
6Therefore I will make + Samaria + a heap in the open country,
7All + her carved images shall be beaten to pieces,
8+ For this I will lament and wail;
9+ For her wound is incurable,
10+ Tell it not in + Gath;
11Pass on your way,
12For the inhabitants of Maroth
13Harness the steeds to the chariots,
14Therefore you shall give parting gifts+ 
15I will again bring + a conqueror to you,
16+ Make yourselves bald and cut off your hair,
