1+ I was ready to be sought by + those who did not ask for me;
2+ I spread out my hands all the day
3a people who provoke me
4who sit in tombs,
5who say, “Keep to yourself,
6Behold, + it is written before me:
7both your iniquities + and your fathers’ iniquities together,
8Thus says the Lord:
9+ I will bring forth offspring from Jacob,
10+ Sharon shall become a pasture for flocks,
11But + you who forsake the Lord,
12I will destine you to the sword,
13Therefore thus says the Lord God:
14behold, + my servants shall sing for gladness of heart,
15You shall leave your name to + my chosen + for a curse,
16So that he who + blesses himself in the land
17“For behold, + I create new heavens
18But be glad and rejoice forever
19+ I will rejoice in Jerusalem
20No more shall there be in it
21+ They shall build houses and inhabit them;
22+ They shall not build and another inhabit;
23+ They shall not labor in vain
24+ Before they call I will answer;
25+ The wolf and the lamb shall graze together;
