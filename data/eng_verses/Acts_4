1And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and + the captain of the temple and + the Sadducees came upon them, 
2greatly annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming + in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. 
3And they arrested them and + put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening. 
4But many of those who had heard the word believed, and + the number of the men came to about five thousand.
5On the next day their rulers and elders and scribes gathered together in Jerusalem, 
6with + Annas the high priest and + Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family. 
7And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, + “By what power or + by what name did you do this?” 
8Then Peter, + filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, “Rulers of the people and elders, 
9if we are being examined today + concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this man has been healed, 
10let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that + by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, + whom God raised from the dead—by him this man is standing before you well. 
11+ This Jesus+  is the stone that was + rejected by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone.+ 
12And there is + salvation + in no one else, for + there is no other + name under heaven given among men+  by which we must be saved.”
13+ Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated, common men, they were astonished. And they recognized that they had been with Jesus. 
14But seeing the man who was healed + standing beside them, + they had nothing to say in opposition. 
15But when they had commanded them to leave the council, they conferred with one another, 
16saying, + “What shall we do with these men? For that + a notable sign has been performed through them is evident to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it. 
17But in order that it may spread no further among the people, let us warn them + to speak no more to anyone in this name.” 
18So they called them and charged them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. 
19But Peter and John answered them, + “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge, 
20for + we cannot but speak of what + we have seen and heard.” 
21And when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, + because of the people, for all were praising God + for what had happened. 
22For the man on whom this sign of healing was performed was more than forty years old.
23When they were released, they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them. 
24And when they heard it, they lifted their voices + together to God and said, “Sovereign Lord, + who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them, 
25who through the mouth of our father David, your servant,+  said by the Holy Spirit,
26The kings of the earth set themselves,
27for truly in this city there were gathered together against your + holy servant Jesus, + whom you anointed, both + Herod and + Pontius Pilate, along + with the Gentiles and + the peoples of Israel, 
28+ to do whatever your hand and + your plan had predestined to take place. 
29And now, Lord, + look upon their threats and grant to your servants+  to continue to speak your word with all + boldness, 
30while + you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed + through the name of your + holy servant Jesus.” 
31And when they had prayed, + the place in which they were gathered together was shaken, and + they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and + continued to speak the word of God with boldness.
32Now the full number of those who believed were of + one heart and + soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but + they had everything in common. 
33And with great + power the apostles were giving their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and + great grace was upon them all. 
34+ There was not a needy person among them, for + as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold 
35and + laid it at the apostles’ feet, and + it was distributed to each as any had need. 
36Thus Joseph, who was also called by the apostles Barnabas (which means + son of encouragement), a Levite, a native of Cyprus, 
37sold a field that belonged to him and brought the money and + laid it at the apostles’ feet.
