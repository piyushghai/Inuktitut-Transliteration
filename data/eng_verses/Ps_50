1+ The Mighty One, God the Lord,
2Out of Zion, + the perfection of beauty,
3Our God comes; he + does not keep silence;+ 
4+ He calls to the heavens above
5“Gather to me my faithful ones,
6+ The heavens declare his righteousness,
7+ “Hear, O my people, and I will speak;
8Not for your sacrifices + do I rebuke you;
9I will not accept a bull from your house
10For every beast of the forest is mine,
11+ I know all the birds of the hills,
12“If I were hungry, I would not tell you,
13Do I eat the flesh of bulls
14+ Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving,+ 
15and + call upon me in the day of trouble;
16But to the wicked God says:
17+ For you hate discipline,
18If you see a thief, + you are pleased with him,
19“You give your mouth free rein for evil,
20You sit and speak against your brother;
21These things you have done, and I + have been silent;
22“Mark this, then, you who + forget God,
23The one who + offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies me;
