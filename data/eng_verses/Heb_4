1Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem + to have failed to reach it. 
2For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because + they were not united by faith with those who listened.+ 
3For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said,
4For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way: + “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.” 
5And again in this passage he said,
6Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news + failed to enter because of disobedience, 
7again he appoints a certain day, “Today,” saying through David so long afterward, in the words already quoted,
8For if Joshua had given them rest, God+  would not have spoken of another day later on. 
9So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God, 
10for whoever has entered God’s rest has also + rested from his works as God did from his.
11Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so + that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience. 
12For + the word of God is living and + active, + sharper than any + two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and + discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. 
13And + no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are + naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.
14Since then we have + a great high priest + who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, + let us hold fast our confession. 
15For we do not have a high priest + who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been + tempted as we are, + yet without sin. 
16+ Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
