1+ Bel bows down; Nebo stoops;
2They stoop; they bow down together;
3“Listen to me, O house of Jacob,
4+ even to your old age I am he,
5+ “To whom will you liken me and make me equal,
6+ Those who lavish gold from the purse,
7+ They lift it to their shoulders, they carry it,
8“Remember this and stand firm,
9remember the former things of old;
10+ declaring the end from the beginning
11+ calling a bird of prey from the east,
12“Listen to me, you stubborn of heart,
13+ I bring near my righteousness; it is not far off,
