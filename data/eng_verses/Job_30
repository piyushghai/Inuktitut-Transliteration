1“But now they + laugh at me,
2What could I gain from the strength of their hands,
3Through want and hard hunger
4they pick saltwort and the leaves of bushes,
5+ They are driven out from human company;
6In the gullies of the torrents they must dwell,
7Among the bushes they + bray;
8A senseless, a nameless brood,
9“And now I have become their + song;
10They + abhor me; they keep aloof from me;
11Because God has loosed my cord and humbled me,
12On my + right hand the rabble rise;
13They break up my path;
14As through a wide + breach they come;
15+ Terrors are turned upon me;
16“And now my soul is + poured out within me;
17+ The night + racks my bones,
18With great force my garment is + disfigured;
19God+  has cast me into the mire,
20I cry to you for help and you do not answer me;
21You have + turned cruel to me;
22+ You lift me up on the wind; you make me ride on it,
23+ For I know that you will bring me to death
24“Yet does not one in a + heap of ruins stretch out his hand,
25Did not I + weep for him whose day was hard?
26But + when I hoped for good, evil came,
27My inward parts are in turmoil and never still;
28I + go about darkened, but not by the sun;
29I am a brother of + jackals
30My + skin turns black and falls from me,
31My + lyre is + turned to mourning,
