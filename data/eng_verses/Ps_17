1Hear a just cause, O Lord; + attend to my cry!
2From your presence + let my vindication come!
3You have + tried my heart, you have + visited me by + night,
4With regard to the works of man, by the word of your lips
5My steps have + held fast to your paths;
6I + call upon you, for you will answer me, O God;
7+ Wondrously show+  your steadfast love,
8Keep me as + the apple of your eye;
9from the wicked who do me violence,
10+ They close their hearts to pity;
11They have now surrounded our + steps;
12He is like a lion eager to tear,
13Arise, O Lord! Confront him, subdue him!
14from men by your hand, O Lord,
15As for me, I shall + behold your face in righteousness;
