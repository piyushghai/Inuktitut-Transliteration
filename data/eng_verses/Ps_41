1+ Blessed is the one who considers the poor!+ 
2the Lord protects him and keeps him alive;
3The Lord sustains him on his sickbed;
4As for me, I said, “O Lord, + be gracious to me;
5My enemies say of me in malice,
6And when one comes to see me, + he utters empty words,
7All who hate me whisper together about me;
8They say, “A deadly thing is poured out+  on him;
9Even my + close friend in whom I trusted,
10But you, O Lord, be gracious to me,
11By this I know that + you delight in me:
12But + you have upheld me because of + my integrity,
13+ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,
