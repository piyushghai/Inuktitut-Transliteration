1Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah. 
2+ She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 
3Jokshan fathered Sheba and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim. 
4The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. 
5+ Abraham gave all he had to Isaac. 
6But to the sons of his concubines Abraham gave gifts, and while he was still living he + sent them away from his son Isaac, eastward + to the east country.
7These are the days of the years of Abraham’s life, 175 years. 
8Abraham + breathed his last and + died in a good old age, an old man and full of years, and was gathered to his people. 
9Isaac and Ishmael + his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, east of Mamre, 
10the field + that Abraham purchased from the Hittites. + There Abraham was buried, with Sarah his wife. 
11After the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac his son. And Isaac settled at + Beer-lahai-roi.
12These are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, + whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s servant, bore to Abraham. 
13+ These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, named in the order of their birth: + Nebaioth, the firstborn of Ishmael; and + Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 
14Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 
15Hadad, + Tema, + Jetur, + Naphish, and Kedemah. 
16These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names, by their villages and by their encampments, + twelve princes according to their tribes. 
17(These are the years of the life of Ishmael: 137 years. He + breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people.) 
18+ They settled from Havilah to + Shur, which is opposite Egypt in the direction of Assyria. He settled+  over against all his kinsmen.
19These are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: + Abraham fathered Isaac, 
20and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, + the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of + Paddan-aram, + the sister of Laban the Aramean, to be his wife. 
21And Isaac prayed to the Lord for his wife, because she was barren. And + the Lord granted his prayer, and Rebekah his wife conceived. 
22The children struggled together within her, and she said, “If it is thus, why is this happening to me?”+  So she went + to inquire of the Lord. 
23And the Lord said to her,
24When her days to give birth were completed, behold, there were twins in her womb. 
25The first came out red, + all his body like a hairy cloak, so they called his name Esau. 
26Afterward his brother came out with + his hand holding Esau’s heel, so + his name was called Jacob.+  Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.
27When the boys grew up, Esau was + a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man, + dwelling in tents. 
28Isaac loved Esau because + he ate of his game, but Rebekah loved Jacob.
29Once when Jacob was cooking stew, Esau came in from the field, and he was exhausted. 
30And Esau said to Jacob, “Let me eat some of that red stew, for I am exhausted!” (Therefore his name was called Edom.+ ) 
31Jacob said, “Sell me your birthright now.” 
32Esau said, “I am about to die; of what use is a birthright to me?” 
33Jacob said, “Swear to me now.” So he swore to him and + sold his birthright to Jacob. 
34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank and rose and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.
