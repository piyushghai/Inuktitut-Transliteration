1+ Oh give thanks to the Lord; + call upon his name;
2Sing to him, sing praises to him;
3Glory in his holy name;
4Seek the Lord and his + strength;
5Remember the + wondrous works that he has done,
6O offspring of + Abraham, his servant,
7He is the Lord our God;
8He + remembers his covenant forever,
9+ the covenant that he made with Abraham,
10which he confirmed to + Jacob as a statute,
11saying, + “To you I will give the land of Canaan
12When they were + few in number,
13wandering from nation to nation,
14he + allowed no one to oppress them;
15saying, + “Touch not my anointed ones,
16When he + summoned a famine on the land
17he had + sent a man ahead of them,
18His + feet were hurt with fetters;
19until + what he had said came to pass,
20+ The king sent and + released him;
21he + made him lord of his house
22to bind+  his princes at his pleasure
23Then + Israel came to Egypt;
24And the Lord+ made his people very fruitful
25He + turned their hearts to hate his people,
26He + sent Moses, his servant,
27+ They performed his signs among them
28He + sent darkness, and made the land dark;
29He turned their waters into blood
30Their land swarmed with frogs,
31He spoke, and there came + swarms of flies,
32He gave them hail for rain,
33He struck down their vines and fig trees,
34He spoke, and the + locusts came,
35which devoured all the vegetation in their land
36He + struck down all the firstborn in their land,
37Then he brought out Israel with + silver and gold,
38+ Egypt was glad when they departed,
39He + spread a cloud for a covering,
40+ They asked, and he + brought quail,
41He opened the rock, and + water gushed out;
42For he + remembered his holy promise,
43So he brought his people out with joy,
44And he + gave them the lands of the nations,
45that they might + keep his statutes
