1“But now, hear my speech, O Job,
2Behold, I + open my mouth;
3My words declare the uprightness of my heart,
4+ The Spirit of God has made me,
5+ Answer me, if you can;
6Behold, I am toward God as you are;
7Behold, no + fear of me need terrify you;
8“Surely you have spoken in my ears,
9You say, ‘I am + pure, without + transgression;
10Behold, he finds occasions against me,
11he + puts my feet in the stocks
12“Behold, in this you are not right. I will answer you,
13Why do you + contend against him,
14For God + speaks in one way,
15In + a dream, in + a vision of + the night,
16then he + opens the ears of men
17that he may turn man aside from his + deed
18he keeps back his soul from the pit,
19“Man is also rebuked with pain on his bed
20so that his + life loathes bread,
21His flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen,
22His soul draws near + the pit,
23If there be for him + an angel,
24and he is merciful to him, and says,
25let his flesh + become fresh with youth;
26then man+ + prays to God, and he accepts him;
27He sings before men and says:
28He has redeemed my + soul from going down + into the pit,
29“Behold, God does all these things,
30to bring back his soul from the pit,
31Pay attention, O Job, listen to me;
32If you have any words, + answer me;
33If not, + listen to me;
