1Now when the wall had been built + and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites had been appointed, 
2I gave + my brother Hanani and Hananiah the governor of + the castle charge over Jerusalem, for he was + a more faithful and God-fearing man than many. 
3And I said to them, “Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot. And while they are still standing guard, let them shut and bar the doors. Appoint guards from among the inhabitants of Jerusalem, some at their guard posts and some in front of their own homes.” 
4The city was wide and large, but the people within it were few, and no houses had been rebuilt.
5Then my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles and the officials and the people to be enrolled by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of + those who came up at the first, and I found written in it:
6+ These were the people of the province who came up out of the captivity of those exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried into exile. They returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his town. 
7They came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, + Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah.

60All the temple servants and the sons of Solomon’s servants were 392.
61+ The following were those who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, + Addon, and Immer, but they could not prove their fathers’ houses nor their descent, whether they belonged to Israel: 
62the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, 642. 
63Also, of the priests: the sons of Hobaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai (who had taken a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by their name). 
64These sought their registration among those enrolled in the genealogies, but it was not found there, so they were excluded from the priesthood as unclean. 
65+ The + governor told them that they were not to partake of the most holy food until a priest with Urim and Thummim should arise.
66The whole assembly together was 42,360, 
67besides their male and female servants, of whom there were 7,337. And they had 245 singers, male and female. 
68Their horses were 736, their mules 245,+ 
69their camels 435, and their donkeys 6,720.
70Now some of the heads of fathers’ houses gave to the work. The + governor gave to the treasury 1,000 darics+  of gold, 50 basins, 30 priests’ garments and 500 minas+  of silver.+ 
71And some of the heads of fathers’ houses gave into the treasury of the work 20,000 darics of gold and 2,200 minas of silver. 
72+ And what the rest of the people gave was 20,000 darics of gold, 2,000 minas of silver, and 67 priests’ garments.
73So the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the temple servants, and all Israel, lived in their towns.
