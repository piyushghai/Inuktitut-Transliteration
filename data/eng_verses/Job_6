1Then Job answered and said:
2“Oh that my vexation were weighed,
3For then it would be heavier than + the sand of the sea;
4For + the arrows of the Almighty are in me;
5Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass,
6Can that which is tasteless be eaten without salt,
7My appetite refuses to touch them;
8“Oh that I might have my request,
9that it would + please God to crush me,
10This would be my comfort;
11What is my strength, that I should wait?
12Is my strength the strength of stones, or is my flesh bronze?
13Have I any help in me,
14“He who + withholds+  kindness from a + friend
15My + brothers are + treacherous as a torrent-bed,
16which are dark with ice,
17When they melt, they disappear;
18The caravans turn aside from their course;
19The caravans of + Tema look,
20They are + ashamed because they were confident;
21For you have now become nothing;
22Have I said, ‘Make me a gift’?
23Or, ‘Deliver me from the adversary’s hand’?
24“Teach me, and I will be silent;
25How forceful are upright words!
26Do you think that you can reprove words,
27You would even + cast lots over the fatherless,
28“But now, be pleased to look at me,
29+ Please turn; let no injustice be done.
30Is there any injustice on my tongue?
