1I + came to my garden, my + sister, my bride,
2I slept, but my heart was awake.
3+ I had put off my garment;
4My beloved put his hand to the latch,
5I arose to open to my beloved,
6I opened to my beloved,
7+ The watchmen found me
8I + adjure you, O + daughters of Jerusalem,
9What is your beloved more than another beloved,
10My beloved is radiant and + ruddy,
11His head is the finest gold;
12His + eyes are like doves
13His + cheeks are like + beds of spices,
14His arms are rods of gold,
15His legs are alabaster columns,
16His + mouth+  is most sweet,
