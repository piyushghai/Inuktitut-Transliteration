1Give ear to my words, O Lord;
2Give attention to the sound of my cry,
3O Lord, in + the morning you hear my voice;
4For you are not a God who delights in wickedness;
5The + boastful shall not + stand before your eyes;
6You destroy those who speak + lies;
7But I, through the abundance of your steadfast love,
8+ Lead me, O Lord, in your righteousness
9For there is no truth in their mouth;
10+ Make them bear their guilt, O God;
11But let all who + take refuge in you + rejoice;
12For you + bless the righteous, O Lord;
