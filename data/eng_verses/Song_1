2Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!
3your + anointing oils are fragrant;
4+ Draw me after you; + let us run.
5I am very dark, but + lovely,
6Do not gaze at me because I am dark,
7Tell me, you + whom my soul loves,
8If you do not know,
9I compare you, + my love,
10+ Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments,
11We will make for you+  ornaments of gold,
12While + the king was on his couch,
13My beloved is to me a sachet of + myrrh
14My beloved is to me a cluster of + henna blossoms
15+ Behold, + you are beautiful, + my love;
16Behold, you are beautiful, + my beloved, truly + delightful.
17the beams of our house are + cedar;
