1I love you, O Lord, my strength.
2The Lord is my + rock and my + fortress and my deliverer,
3I call upon the Lord, who is + worthy to be praised,
4+ The cords of death encompassed me;
5+ the cords of Sheol entangled me;
6+ In my distress I called upon the Lord;
7Then the earth + reeled and rocked;
8Smoke went up from his nostrils,+ 
9He + bowed the heavens and + came down;
10He rode on a cherub and flew;
11He made darkness his covering, his + canopy around him,
12Out of the brightness before him
13The Lord also + thundered in the heavens,
14And he sent out his + arrows and scattered them;
15Then + the channels of the sea were seen,
16He + sent from on high, he took me;
17He rescued me from my strong enemy
18They confronted me in the day of my calamity,
19He brought me out into + a broad place;
20The Lord dealt with me + according to my righteousness;
21For I have + kept the ways of the Lord,
22For + all his rules+  were before me,
23I was + blameless before him,
24So the Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness,
25With + the merciful you show yourself merciful;
26with the purified you show yourself pure;
27For you save + a humble people,
28For it is you who light my + lamp;
29For by you I can run against a troop,
30This Godâ€”his way is + perfect;+ 
31For + who is God, but the Lord?
32the God who + equipped me with strength
33He made my feet like the feet of a + deer
34He + trains my hands for war,
35You have given me the shield of your salvation,
36You + gave a wide place for my steps under me,
37I pursued my enemies and overtook them,
38I thrust them through, so that they were not able to rise;
39For you equipped me with strength for the battle;
40You made my enemies + turn their backs to me,+ 
41+ They cried for help, but there was none to save;
42I beat them fine as + dust before the wind;
43You delivered me from + strife with the people;
44As soon as they heard of me they obeyed me;
45+ Foreigners lost heart
46The Lord lives, and blessed be my rock,
47the God who gave me vengeance
48who delivered me from my enemies;
49+ For this I will praise you, O Lord, among the nations,
50Great + salvation he brings to his king,
