1Ask rain + from the Lord
2For + the household gods + utter nonsense,
3+ “My anger is hot against the shepherds,
4From him shall come + the cornerstone,
5They shall be like mighty men in battle,
6+ “I will strengthen the house of Judah,
7Then Ephraim shall become like a mighty warrior,
8+ “I will whistle for them and + gather them in,
9+ Though I scattered them among the nations,
10+ I will bring them home from the land of Egypt,
11+ He shall pass through the sea of troubles
12+ I will make them strong in the Lord,
