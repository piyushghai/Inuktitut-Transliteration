1For God alone + my soul + waits in silence;
2+ He alone is my rock and my salvation,
3How long will all of you attack a man
4They only plan to thrust him down from his + high position.
5For God alone, O + my soul, wait in silence,
6+ He only is my rock and my salvation,
7On God rests my + salvation and my glory;
8+ Trust in him at all times, O people;
9+ Those of low estate are but a breath;
10Put no trust in extortion;
11+ Once God has spoken;
12and that to you, O Lord, + belongs steadfast love.
