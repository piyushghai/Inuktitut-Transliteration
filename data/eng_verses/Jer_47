1The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet + concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh struck down + Gaza.
2â€œThus says the Lord:
3At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his stallions,
4because of the day that is coming to destroy
5+ Baldness has come upon Gaza;
6+ Ah, sword of the Lord!
7How can it+  be quiet
