1+ Be not silent, O + God of my praise!
2For wicked and + deceitful mouths are opened against me,
3They encircle me with words of hate,
4In return for my love they + accuse me,
5So they + reward me evil for good,
6+ Appoint a wicked man + against him;
7When he is tried, let him come forth guilty;
8May his + days be few;
9May his + children be fatherless
10May his children + wander about and beg,
11May + the creditor seize all that he has;
12Let there be none to + extend kindness to him,
13May his + posterity be cut off;
14May + the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the Lord,
15+ Let them be before the Lord continually,
16For he did not remember to show kindness,
17+ He loved to curse; let curses come+  upon him!
18He + clothed himself with cursing as his coat;
19May it be like a garment that he wraps around him,
20May this be the reward of my + accusers from the Lord,
21But you, O God my Lord,
22For I am + poor and needy,
23I am gone like + a shadow at evening;
24My knees are weak + through fasting;
25I am + an object of scorn to my accusers;
26+ Help me, O Lord my God!
27Let them + know that this is your hand;
28+ Let them curse, but you will bless!
29May my accusers be + clothed with dishonor;
30With my mouth I will give great thanks to the Lord;
31For he stands + at the right hand of the needy one,
