1By the waters of Babylon,
2On the willows+  there
3For there our captors
4+ How shall we sing the Lordâ€™s song
5If I forget you, O Jerusalem,
6Let my + tongue stick to the roof of my mouth,
7Remember, O Lord, against the + Edomites
8O daughter of Babylon, + doomed to be destroyed,
9Blessed shall he be who takes your little ones
