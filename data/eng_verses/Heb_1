1Long ago, at many times and + in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, 
2but + in these last days + he has spoken to us by + his Son, whom he appointed + the heir of all things, + through whom also he created + the world. 
3He is the radiance of the glory of God and + the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power. + After making purification for sins, + he sat down + at the right hand of the Majesty on high, 
4having become as much superior to angels as the name + he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.
5For to which of the angels did God ever say,
6And again, when he brings + the firstborn into the world, he says,
7Of the angels he says,
8But of the Son he says,
9You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;
10And,
11they will perish, but you remain;
12like a robe you will roll them up,
13And to which of the angels has he ever said,
14Are they not all ministering spirits + sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to + inherit salvation?
