1And Elihu continued, and said:
2“Bear with me a little, and I will show you,
3I will get my knowledge from + afar
4For truly my words are not false;
5“Behold, God is mighty, and + does not despise any;
6He does not keep the wicked alive,
7He does not withdraw his + eyes from the righteous,
8And if they are + bound in chains
9then he declares to them their work
10He + opens their ears to instruction
11+ If they listen and serve him,
12But if they do not listen, they + perish by the sword
13“The + godless in heart cherish anger;
14They + die in youth,
15He delivers + the afflicted by their affliction
16He also allured you out of distress
17“But you are full of the judgment on the wicked;
18Beware lest wrath entice you into scoffing,
19Will your + cry for help avail to keep you from distress,
20Do not long for + the night,
21Take care; + do not turn to iniquity,
22Behold, God is exalted in his power;
23Who has + prescribed for him his way,
24“Remember to + extol his work,
25All mankind has looked on it;
26Behold, God is great, and we + know him not;
27For he draws up the drops of water;
28which + the skies pour down
29Can anyone understand + the spreading of the clouds,
30Behold, he scatters his lightning about him
31For by these he + judges peoples;
32He covers his + hands with the lightning
33Its crashing declares his presence;+
