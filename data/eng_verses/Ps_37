1+ + Fret not yourself because of evildoers;
2For they will soon + fade like + the grass
3+ Trust in the Lord, and do good;
4+ Delight yourself in the Lord,
5+ Commit your way to the Lord;
6+ He will bring forth your righteousness as the light,
7+ Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him;
8+ Refrain from anger, and forsake wrath!
9+ For the evildoers shall be cut off,
10In + just a little while, the wicked will be no more;
11But + the meek shall inherit the land
12The wicked + plots against the righteous
13but the Lord + laughs at the wicked,
14The wicked draw the sword and + bend their bows
15their sword shall enter their own heart,
16+ Better is the little that the righteous has
17For + the arms of the wicked shall be broken,
18The Lord+ knows the days of the blameless,
19they are not put to shame in evil times;
20But the wicked will perish;
21The wicked borrows but does not pay back,
22for those blessed by the Lord+  shall + inherit the land,
23The + steps of a man are + established by the Lord,
24+ though he fall, he shall not be cast headlong,
25I have been young, and now am old,
26He is ever + lending generously,
27+ Turn away from evil and do good;
28For the Lord+ loves justice;
29The righteous shall inherit the land
30The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom,
31+ The law of his God is in his heart;
32The wicked + watches for the righteous
33The Lord will not + abandon him to his power
34+ Wait for the Lord and keep his way,
35+ I have seen a wicked, ruthless man,
36But he passed away,+  and behold, + he was no more;
37Mark the blameless and behold the upright,
38But + transgressors shall be altogether destroyed;
39+ The salvation of the righteous is from the Lord;
40The Lord helps them and + delivers them;
