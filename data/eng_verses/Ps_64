1Hear my voice, O God, in my + complaint;
2Hide me from + the secret plots of the wicked,
3who + whet their tongues like swords,
4shooting from + ambush at the blameless,
5They + hold fast to their evil purpose;
6They search out injustice,
7+ But God shoots his arrow at them;
8They are brought to ruin, with their own + tongues turned against them;
9Then all mankind + fears;
10Let + the righteous one rejoice in the Lord
