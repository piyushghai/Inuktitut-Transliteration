1These also are + proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied.
2It is the glory of God to + conceal things,
3As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth,
4Take away + the dross from the silver,
5take away + the wicked from the presence of the king,
6Do not put yourself forward in the king’s presence
7for + it is better to be told, “Come up here,”
8+ do not hastily bring into court,
9+ Argue your case with your neighbor himself,
10lest he who hears you bring shame upon you,
11+ A word fitly spoken
12Like + a gold ring or an ornament of gold
13Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest
14Like + clouds and wind without rain
15With + patience a ruler may be persuaded,
16If you have + found honey, eat + only enough for you,
17Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house,
18A man who + bears false witness against his neighbor
19Trusting in a treacherous man in time of trouble
20Whoever + sings songs to a heavy heart
21+ If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat,
22for you will heap + burning coals on his head,
23The north wind brings forth rain,
24+ It is better to live in a corner of the housetop
25Like cold water to + a thirsty soul,
26Like + a muddied spring or a polluted fountain
27It is + not good to eat much honey,
28A man + without self-control
