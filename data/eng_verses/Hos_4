1+ Hear the word of the Lord, O children of Israel,
2+ there is swearing, lying, murder, stealing, and committing adultery;
3Therefore + the land mourns,
4+ Yet let no one contend,
5You shall stumble by day;
6My people are destroyed + for lack of knowledge;
7+ The more they increased,
8+ They feed on the sin+  of my people;
9+ And it shall be like people, like priest;
10+ They shall eat, but not be satisfied;
11whoredom, wine, and new wine,
12My people + inquire of a piece of wood,
13+ They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains
14I will not punish your daughters when they play the whore,
15Though you play the whore, O + Israel,
16Like a stubborn heifer,
17+ Ephraim is joined to idols;
18When their drink is gone, they give themselves to whoring;
19+ A wind has wrapped them+  in its wings,
