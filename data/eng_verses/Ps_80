1Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel,
2Before + Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh,
3+ Restore us,+  O God;
4O + Lord God of hosts,
5You have fed them with + the bread of tears
6+ You make us an object of contention for our + neighbors,
7+ Restore us, O God of hosts;
8You brought + a vine out of Egypt;
9You + cleared the ground for it;
10The mountains were covered with its shade,
11It sent out its branches to + the sea
12Why then have you + broken down its walls,
13+ The boar from the forest ravages it,
14Turn again, O God of hosts!
15the stock that your right hand planted,
16They have + burned it with fire; they have + cut it down;
17But + let your hand be on the man of your right hand,
18Then we shall not turn back from you;
19+ Restore us, O Lord God of hosts!
