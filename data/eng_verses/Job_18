1Then + Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
2“How long will you + hunt for words?
3Why are we counted as + cattle?
4You who + tear yourself in your anger,
5“Indeed, + the light of the wicked is put out,
6The light is + dark in his tent,
7His strong steps are shortened,
8For he is cast into a net by his own feet,
9+ A trap seizes him by the heel;
10A rope is hidden for him in the ground,
11+ Terrors frighten him on every side,
12His strength is famished,
13It consumes the parts of his skin;
14He is torn from the tent in which he trusted
15In his tent dwells that which is none of his;
16His + roots dry up beneath,
17His + memory perishes from the earth,
18+ He is thrust from light into darkness,
19He has no + posterity or progeny among his people,
20They of the west are appalled at his + day,
21Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous,
