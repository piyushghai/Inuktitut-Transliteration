1Then I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne + a scroll written within and on the back, + sealed with seven seals. 
2And + I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?” 
3And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it, 
4and I began to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it. 
5And one of the elders said to me, “Weep no more; behold, + the Lion + of the tribe of Judah, + the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals.”
6And between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders I saw + a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, with seven horns and with + seven eyes, which are + the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth. 
7And he went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne. 
8And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders + fell down before the Lamb, + each holding a harp, and + golden bowls full of incense, + which are the prayers of the saints. 
9And they sang + a new song, saying,
10and you have made them + a kingdom and priests to our God,
11Then I looked, and I heard around the throne and the living creatures and the elders the voice of many angels, numbering + myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands, 
12saying with a loud voice,
13And I heard + every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and all that is in them, saying,
14And the four living creatures + said, “Amen!” and the elders + fell down and worshiped.
