1+ The + fool says in his heart, + “There is no God.”
2The Lord+ looks down from heaven on the children of man,
3They have all turned aside; together they have become + corrupt;
4Have they no + knowledge, all the evildoers
5There they are in great terror,
6You would shame the plans of the poor,
7Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion!
