1O God, + you have rejected us, + broken our defenses;
2You have made the land to quake; you have torn it open;
3+ You have made your people see hard things;
4You have set up + a banner for those who fear you,
5+ That your + beloved ones may be delivered,
6God has spoken + in his holiness:+ 
7+ Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine;
8+ Moab is my washbasin;
9Who will bring me to the fortified city?
10Have you not + rejected us, O God?
11Oh, grant us help against the foe,
12With God we shall + do valiantly;
