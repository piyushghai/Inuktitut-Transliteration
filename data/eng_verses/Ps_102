1+ Hear my prayer, O Lord;
2+ Do not hide your face from me
3For my days + pass away like smoke,
4My heart is + struck down like grass and + has withered;
5Because of my loud groaning
6I am like + a desert owl of the wilderness,
7I + lie awake;
8All the day my enemies taunt me;
9For I eat ashes like bread
10because of your indignation and anger;
11My days are like + an evening shadow;
12But you, O Lord, are + enthroned forever;
13You will + arise and have + pity on Zion;
14For your servants hold her + stones dear
15Nations will + fear the name of the Lord,
16For the Lord+ builds up Zion;
17he + regards the prayer of the destitute
18Let this be + recorded for + a generation to come,
19that he + looked down from his holy height;
20to hear + the groans of the prisoners,
21that they may + declare in Zion the name of the Lord,
22when + peoples gather together,
23He has broken my strength in midcourse;
24“O my God,” + I say, “take me not away
25+ Of old you laid the foundation of the earth,
26+ They will perish, but + you will remain;
27but + you are the same, and your years have no end.
28+ The children of your servants + shall dwell secure;
