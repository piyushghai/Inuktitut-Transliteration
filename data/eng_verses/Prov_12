1Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge,
2A good man + obtains favor from the Lord,
3No one is established by wickedness,
4+ An excellent wife is + the crown of her husband,
5+ The thoughts of the righteous are just;
6The words of the wicked + lie in wait for blood,
7+ The wicked are + overthrown and are no more,
8A man is commended according to his good sense,
9Better to be lowly and have a servant
10+ Whoever is righteous has regard for the life of his beast,
11+ Whoever works his land + will have plenty of bread,
12Whoever is wicked covets + the spoil of evildoers,
13An evil man is ensnared + by the transgression of his lips,
14From the fruit of his mouth + a man is satisfied with good,
15+ The way of a fool is right in his own eyes,
16+ The vexation of a fool is known at once,
17+ Whoever speaks+  the truth gives honest evidence,
18+ There is one whose rash words are like sword thrusts,
19Truthful lips endure forever,
20Deceit is in the heart of + those who devise evil,
21+ No ill befalls the righteous,
22+ Lying lips are + an abomination to the Lord,
23+ A prudent man conceals knowledge,
24+ The hand of the diligent will rule,
25+ Anxiety in a manâ€™s heart weighs him down,
26One who is righteous is a guide to his neighbor,+ 
27+ Whoever is slothful will not roast his game,
28+ In the path of righteousness is life,
