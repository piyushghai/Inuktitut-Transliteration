1Woe is me! For I have become
2+ The godly has perished from the earth,
3+ Their hands are on what is evil, to do it well;
4The best of them is + like a brier,
5+ Put no trust in a neighbor;
6for + the son treats the father with contempt,
7But as for me, I will look to the Lord;
8+ Rejoice not over me, O + my enemy;
9+ I will bear the indignation of the Lord
10Then + my enemy will see,
11+ A day for the building of your walls!
12In that day they+  will come to you,
13But + the earth will be desolate
14+ Shepherd your people + with your staff,
15+ As in the days when you came out of the land of Egypt,
16+ The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might;
17+ they shall lick the dust like a serpent,
18+ Who is a God like you, + pardoning iniquity
19He will + again have compassion on us;
20+ You will show faithfulness to Jacob
