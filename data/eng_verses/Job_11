1Then + Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:
2“Should + a multitude of words go unanswered,
3Should your babble silence men,
4For + you say, ‘My + doctrine is pure,
5But oh, that God would speak
6and that he would tell you the secrets of wisdom!
7+ “Can you find out the deep things of God?
8It is + higher than heaven+ —what can you do?
9Its measure is longer than the earth
10If he + passes through and + imprisons
11For he knows + worthless men;
12But a stupid man will get understanding
13“If you + prepare your heart,
14If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away,
15Surely then you will + lift up your face without + blemish;
16You will + forget your misery;
17And your life will be + brighter than the noonday;
18And you will feel secure, because there is hope;
19You will + lie down, and none will make you afraid;
20But + the eyes of the wicked will fail;
