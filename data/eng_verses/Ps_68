1+ God shall arise, his enemies shall be + scattered;
2As + smoke is driven away, so you shall drive them away;
3But + the righteous shall be glad;
4Sing to God, + sing praises to his name;
5+ Father of the fatherless and + protector of widows
6God + settles the solitary in a home;
7O God, when you + went out before your people,
8+ the earth quaked, the heavens poured down rain,
9+ Rain in abundance, O God, you shed abroad;
10your flock+  found a dwelling in it;
11The Lord gives + the word;
12+ “The kings of the armies—they flee, they flee!”
13though you men lie among + the sheepfolds—
14When the Almighty scatters kings there,
15O mountain of God, mountain of Bashan;
16Why do you look with hatred, O many-peaked mountain,
17+ The chariots of God are twice ten thousand,
18+ You ascended on high,
19Blessed be the Lord,
20Our God is a God of salvation,
21+ But God will strike the heads of his enemies,
22The Lord said,
23that you may + strike your feet in their blood,
24Your procession is+  seen, O God,
25+ the singers in front, + the musicians last,
26+ “Bless God in the great congregation,
27There is + Benjamin, the least of them, in the lead,
28+ Summon your power, O God,+ 
29Because of your temple at Jerusalem
30Rebuke + the beasts that dwell among the reeds,
31Nobles shall come from + Egypt;
32+ O kingdoms of the earth, sing to God;
33to him + who rides in + the heavens, the ancient heavens;
34+ Ascribe power to God,
35+ Awesome is God from his+ + sanctuary;
