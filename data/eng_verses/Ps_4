1Answer me when I call, O God of my + righteousness!
2O men,+  how long shall my honor be turned into shame?
3But know that the Lord has + set apart + the godly for himself;
4+ Be angry,+  and do not sin;
5Offer + right sacrifices,
6There are many who say, â€œWho will show us some good?
7You have put + more joy in my heart
8In peace I will both + lie down and sleep;
