1+  To you, O Lord, I + lift up my soul.
2O my God, in you I + trust;
3Indeed, + none who wait for you shall be put to shame;
4+ Make me to know your ways, O Lord;
5Lead me in your + truth and teach me,
6Remember your + mercy, O Lord, and your steadfast love,
7Remember not + the sins of my youth or my transgressions;
8+ Good and upright is the Lord;
9He leads the humble in what is right,
10All the paths of the Lord are + steadfast love and faithfulness,
11For your + nameâ€™s sake, O Lord,
12Who is the man who fears the Lord?
13His soul shall + abide in well-being,
14+ The friendship+  of the Lord is for those who fear him,
15My + eyes are ever toward the Lord,
16+ Turn to me and be gracious to me,
17The troubles of my heart are enlarged;
18+ Consider my affliction and my trouble,
19Consider how many are my foes,
20Oh, guard my soul, and deliver me!
21May integrity and uprightness preserve me,
22+ Redeem Israel, O God,
