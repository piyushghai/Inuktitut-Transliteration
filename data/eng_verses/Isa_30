1“Ah, + stubborn children,” declares the Lord,
2+ who set out to go down to Egypt,
3+ Therefore shall the protection of Pharaoh turn to your shame,
4For though his officials are at + Zoan
5everyone comes to shame
6An + oracle on + the beasts of + the Negeb.
7Egypt’s + help is worthless and empty;
8And now, go, + write it before them on a tablet
9+ For they are a rebellious people,
10+ who say to + the seers, “Do not see,”
11leave the way, turn aside from the path,
12Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel,
13therefore this iniquity shall be to you
14and its breaking is + like that of a potter’s vessel
15For thus said the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel,
16and you said,
17+ A thousand shall flee at the threat of one;
18Therefore the Lord+ waits to be gracious to you,
19For a people shall dwell + in Zion, in Jerusalem; you shall weep no more. He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry. As soon as he hears it, he answers you. 
20And though the Lord give you the + bread of adversity and the + water of affliction, + yet your Teacher will not hide himself anymore, but your eyes shall see your Teacher. 
21+ And your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, “This is + the way, walk in it,” when you turn to the right or when you turn to the left. 
22Then you will defile your carved idols overlaid with silver and your gold-plated metal images. + You will scatter them as unclean things. You will say to them, “Be gone!”
23+ And he will give + rain for the seed with which you sow the ground, and bread, the produce of the ground, which will be rich and plenteous. + In that day your livestock will graze in large pastures, 
24and + the oxen and the donkeys that work the ground will eat seasoned fodder, which has been winnowed with shovel and fork. 
25And + on every lofty mountain and every high hill there will be brooks running with water, in the day of the great slaughter, + when the towers fall. 
26+ Moreover, the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day when + the Lord binds up + the brokenness of his people, and heals the wounds inflicted by his blow.
27Behold, the name of the Lord comes from afar,
28+ his breath is + like an overflowing stream
29You shall have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept, and gladness of heart, + as when one sets out to the sound of the flute to go to + the mountain of the Lord, to + the Rock of Israel. 
30And the Lord+ will cause his majestic voice to be heard and the descending blow of his arm to be seen, in furious anger + and a flame of devouring fire, with a cloudburst + and storm and hailstones. 
31The Assyrians will be terror-stricken at the voice of the Lord, + when he strikes with his rod. 
32And every stroke of the appointed staff that the Lord lays on them + will be to the sound of tambourines and lyres. + Battling with brandished arm, he will fight with them. 
33For + a burning place+  has long been prepared; indeed, for the king it is made ready, + its pyre made deep and wide, with fire and wood in abundance; + the breath of the Lord, like a stream of sulfur, kindles it.
