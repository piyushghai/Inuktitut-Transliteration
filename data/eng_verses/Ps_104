1+ Bless the Lord, O my soul!
2covering yourself with light as with a garment,
3He + lays the beams of his + chambers on the waters;
4he + makes his messengers winds,
5He + set the earth on its foundations,
6You + covered it with the deep as with a garment;
7At + your rebuke they fled;
8The mountains rose, the valleys sank down
9You set + a boundary that they may not pass,
10You make springs gush forth in the valleys;
11they + give drink to every beast of the field;
12Beside them the birds of the heavens dwell;
13+ From your lofty abode you + water the mountains;
14You cause + the grass to grow for the livestock
15and + wine to gladden the heart of man,
16The trees of the Lord are watered abundantly,
17In them the birds build their nests;
18The high mountains are for + the wild goats;
19He made the moon to mark the + seasons;+ 
20+ You make darkness, and it is night,
21+ The young lions roar for their prey,
22When the sun rises, they steal away
23+ Man goes out to his work
24O Lord, how manifold are your works!
25Here is the sea, great and wide,
26There go the ships,
27These + all look to you,
28When you give it to them, they gather it up;
29When you + hide your face, they are + dismayed;
30When you + send forth your Spirit,+  they are created,
31May the glory of the Lord+ endure forever;
32who looks on the earth and it + trembles,
33I will sing to the Lord+ as long as I live;
34May my + meditation be pleasing to him,
35Let + sinners be consumed from the earth,
