1When you sit down to eat with a ruler,
2and put a knife to your throat
3+ Do not desire his delicacies,
4+ Do not toil to acquire wealth;
5When your eyes light on it, it is gone,
6+ Do not eat the bread of a man who is + stingy;+ 
7for he is like one who is inwardly calculating.+ 
8You will vomit up the morsels that you have eaten,
9Do not speak in the hearing of a fool,
10+ Do not move an ancient landmark
11for their + Redeemer is strong;
12Apply your heart to instruction
13Do not withhold + discipline from a child;
14If you strike him with the rod,
15+ My son, if your heart is wise,
16My + inmost being+  will exult
17Let not your heart + envy sinners,
18Surely + there is a future,
19Hear, my son, and + be wise,
20Be not among + drunkards+ 
21for the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty,
22+ Listen to your father who gave you life,
23+ Buy truth, and do not sell it;
24+ The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice;
25+ Let your father and mother be glad;
26My son, give me your heart,
27For a prostitute is + a deep pit;
28+ She lies in wait like a robber
29+ Who has woe? Who has sorrow?
30Those who + tarry long over wine;
31Do not look at wine when it is red,
32In the end it + bites like a serpent
33Your eyes will see strange things,
34You will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea,
35“They + struck me,” you will say,+  “but I was not hurt;
