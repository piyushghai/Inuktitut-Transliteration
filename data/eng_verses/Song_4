1Behold, + you are beautiful, my love,
2Your + teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes
3Your lips are like + a scarlet thread,
4Your + neck is like the tower of David,
5Your + two breasts are like two + fawns,
6+ Until the day breathes
7+ You are altogether beautiful, my love;
8+ Come with me from + Lebanon, my + bride;
9You have captivated my heart, my + sister, my bride;
10How beautiful is your love, my + sister, my bride!
11Your + lips drip nectar, my bride;
12A garden locked is my + sister, my bride,
13Your shoots are + an orchard of pomegranates
14nard and saffron, + calamus and + cinnamon,
15a garden fountain, a well of + living water,
16Awake, O north wind,
