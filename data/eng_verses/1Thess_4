1Finally, then, brothers,+  we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus, that as you + received from us + how you ought to walk and + to please God, just as you are doing, that you + do so more and more. 
2For + you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus. 
3For this is the will of God, + your sanctification:+ + that you abstain from sexual immorality; 
4that each one of you know how to control his own + body+  in holiness and + honor, 
5not in + the passion of lust + like the Gentiles + who do not know God; 
6that no one transgress and + wrong his brother in this matter, because the Lord is + an avenger in all these things, as we told you beforehand and solemnly warned you. 
7For + God has not called us for + impurity, but in holiness. 
8Therefore + whoever disregards this, disregards not man but God, + who gives his Holy Spirit to you.
9Now concerning + brotherly love + you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you yourselves have been + taught by God + to love one another, 
10for that indeed is what + you are doing to all the brothers throughout Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to + do this more and more, 
11and to aspire + to live quietly, and + to mind your own affairs, and + to work with your hands, as we instructed you, 
12so that you may + walk properly before + outsiders and be dependent on no one.
13But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, + that you may not grieve as others do + who have no hope. 
14For + since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him + those who have fallen asleep. 
15For this we declare to you + by a word from the Lord,+  that + we who are alive, who are left until + the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. 
16For + the Lord himself will descend + from heaven + with a cry of command, with the voice of + an archangel, and + with the sound of the trumpet of God. And + the dead in Christ will rise first. 
17Then we who are alive, who are left, will be + caught up together with them + in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so + we will always be with the Lord. 
18Therefore encourage one another with these words.
