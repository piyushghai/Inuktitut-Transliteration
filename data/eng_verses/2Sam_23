1Now these are the last words of David:
2+ “The Spirit of the Lord speaks by me;
3The God of Israel has spoken;
4he + dawns on them like the morning light,
5“For does not my house stand so with God?
6But worthless men+  are all like thorns that are thrown away,
7but the man who touches them
8+ These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: + Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite; he was chief of the three.+  He wielded his spear+  against eight hundred whom he killed at one time.
9And next to him among the three mighty men was Eleazar the son of + Dodo, son of + Ahohi. He was with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there for battle, and the men of Israel withdrew. 
10He rose and struck down the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clung to the sword. And the Lord brought about a great victory that day, and the men returned after him only to strip the slain.
11And next to him was Shammah, the son of Agee the + Hararite. The Philistines gathered together at Lehi, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils, and the men fled from the Philistines. 
12But he took his stand in the midst of the plot and defended it and struck down the Philistines, and the Lord worked a great victory.
13And three of the thirty chief men went down and came about harvest time to David at the + cave of Adullam, when a band of Philistines was encamped + in the Valley of Rephaim. 
14David was then + in the stronghold, and + the garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem. 
15And David said longingly, “Oh, that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!” 
16Then the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and carried and brought it to David. But he would not drink of it. He poured it out to the Lord 
17and said, “Far be it from me, O Lord, that I should do this. Shall I drink + the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives?” Therefore he would not drink it. These things the three mighty men did.
18Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the thirty.+  And he wielded his spear against three hundred men+  and killed them and won a name beside the three. 
19He was the most renowned of the thirty+  and became their commander, but he did not attain to + the three.
20And + Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a valiant man+  of + Kabzeel, a doer of great deeds. He struck down two ariels+  of Moab. He also went down and struck down a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen. 
21And he struck down an Egyptian, a handsome man. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but Benaiah went down to him with a staff and snatched the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear. 
22These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and won a name beside the three mighty men. 
23He was renowned among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David set him over his bodyguard.
24+ Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, 
25+ Shammah of Harod, Elika of Harod, 
26Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh + of Tekoa, 
27Abiezer + of Anathoth, Mebunnai + the Hushathite, 
28Zalmon + the Ahohite, Maharai + of Netophah, 
29Heleb the son of Baanah + of Netophah, Ittai the son of Ribai of + Gibeah of the people of Benjamin, 
30Benaiah + of Pirathon, Hiddai of the brooks of + Gaash, 
31Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth of + Bahurim, 
32Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan, 
33+ Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite, 
34Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai + of Maacah, + Eliam the son of + Ahithophel of Gilo, 
35Hezro+ + of Carmel, Paarai the Arbite, 
36Igal the son of Nathan + of Zobah, Bani the Gadite, 
37Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai + of Beeroth, the armor-bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah, 
38+ Ira the + Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 
39+ Uriah the Hittite: thirty-seven in all.
