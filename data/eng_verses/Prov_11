1+ A false balance is an abomination to the Lord,
2+ When pride comes, then comes disgrace,
3+ The integrity of the upright guides them,
4+ Riches do not profit in the day of wrath,
5The righteousness of the blameless + keeps his way straight,
6+ The righteousness of the upright delivers them,
7When the wicked dies, his + hope will perish,
8+ The righteous is delivered from trouble,
9With his mouth the godless man would destroy his neighbor,
10+ When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices,
11By the blessing of the upright a city is exalted,
12Whoever + belittles his neighbor lacks sense,
13Whoever + goes about slandering reveals secrets,
14Where there is + no guidance, a people falls,
15+ Whoever puts up security for a stranger will surely suffer harm,
16+ A gracious woman gets honor,
17+ A man who is kind benefits himself,
18The wicked earns deceptive wages,
19Whoever is steadfast in righteousness + will live,
20Those of + crooked heart are + an abomination to the Lord,
21+ Be assured, + an evil person will not go unpunished,
22Like + a gold ring in a pigâ€™s snout
23The desire of the righteous ends only in good;
24+ One gives + freely, yet grows all the richer;
25+ Whoever brings blessing + will be enriched,
26+ The people curse him who holds back grain,
27Whoever diligently seeks good seeks favor,+ 
28Whoever + trusts in his riches will fall,
29Whoever + troubles his own household will + inherit the wind,
30The fruit of the righteous is + a tree of life,
31If + the righteous is repaid on earth,
