1O Lord, you have + searched me and known me!
2You + know when I sit down and when I rise up;
3You search out my path and my lying down
4Even before a word is on my tongue,
5You + hem me in, behind and before,
6+ Such knowledge is + too wonderful for me;
7+ Where shall I go from your Spirit?
8+ If I ascend to heaven, you are there!
9If I take the wings of the morning
10even there your hand shall + lead me,
11If I say, + â€œSurely the darkness shall cover me,
12+ even the darkness is not dark to you;
13For you + formed my inward parts;
14I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.+ 
15+ My frame was not hidden from you,
16Your eyes saw my unformed substance;
17How precious to me are your + thoughts, O God!
18+ If I would count them, they are more than + the sand.
19Oh that you would + slay the wicked, O God!
20They + speak against you with malicious intent;
21+ Do I not hate those who hate you, O Lord?
22I hate them with complete hatred;
23Search me, O God, and know my heart!
24And see if there be any grievous way in me,
