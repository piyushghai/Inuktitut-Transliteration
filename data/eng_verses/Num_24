1When Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel, he did not go, as at + other times, to look for omens, but set his face toward the wilderness. 
2And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel + camping tribe by tribe. And + the Spirit of God came upon him, 
3and he + took up his discourse and said,
4the oracle of him who hears the words of God,
5How lovely are your tents, O Jacob,
6Like palm groves+  that stretch afar,
7Water shall flow from his buckets,
8God brings him out of Egypt
9He crouched, he lay down like a lion
10And Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he + struck his hands together. And Balak said to Balaam, + “I called you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have blessed them these three times. 
11Therefore now flee to your own place. I said, + ‘I will certainly honor you,’ but the Lord has held you back from honor.” 
12And Balaam said to Balak, “Did I not tell your messengers whom you sent to me, 
13+ ‘If Balak should give me his house full of silver and gold, I would not be able to go beyond the word of the Lord, to do either good or bad + of my own will. What the Lord speaks, that will I speak’? 
14And now, behold, I am going to my people. Come, + I will let you know what this people will do to your people + in the latter days.”
15+ And he took up his discourse and said,
16the oracle of him who hears the words of God,
17+ I see him, but not now;
18+ Edom shall be dispossessed;
19And one from Jacob shall exercise dominion
20Then he looked on Amalek and + took up his discourse and said,
21And he looked on the Kenite, and took up his discourse and said,
22Nevertheless, Kain shall be burned
23And he took up his discourse and said,
24But ships shall come from + Kittim
25Then Balaam rose and + went back to his place. And Balak also went his way.
