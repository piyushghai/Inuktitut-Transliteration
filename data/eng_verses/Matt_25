1“Then the kingdom of heaven will be like + ten virgins who took their lamps+ and went to meet + the bridegroom.+ 
2Five of them were foolish, and five were + wise.
3For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them,
4but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps.
5As the bridegroom + was delayed, they all became drowsy and slept.
6But + at midnight there was a cry, ‘Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.’
7Then all those virgins rose and + trimmed their lamps.
8And the foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’
9But the wise answered, saying, ‘Since there will not be enough for us and for you, go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.’
10And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and + those who were ready went in with him to + the marriage feast, and + the door was shut.
11Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, + ‘Lord, lord, open to us.’
12+ But he answered, ‘Truly, I say to you, + I do not know you.’
13+ Watch therefore, for you + know neither the day nor the hour.
14+ “For + it will be like a man + going on a journey, who called his servants+ and entrusted to them his property.
15To one he gave five + talents,+ to another two, to another one, + to each according to his ability. Then he + went away.
16He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more.
17So also he who had the two talents made two talents more.
18But he who had received the one talent went and + dug in the ground and hid his master’s money.
19Now + after a long time the master of those servants came and + settled accounts with them.
20And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me five talents; here I have made five talents more.’
21His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and + faithful servant.+ + You have been faithful over a little; + I will set you over much. Enter into + the joy of your master.’
22And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me two talents; here I have made two talents more.’
23His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’
24He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, ‘Master, I knew you to be + a hard man, reaping + where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed,
25so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here + you have what is yours.’
26But his master answered him, ‘You + wicked and + slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I scattered no seed?
27Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest.
28So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents.
29+ For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.
30And + cast + the worthless servant into the outer darkness. In that place + there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’
31+ “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, + then he will sit on his glorious throne.
32Before him + will be gathered + all the nations, and + he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates + the sheep from the goats.
33And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left.
34Then + the King will say to + those on his right, ‘Come, you + who are blessed by my Father, + inherit + the kingdom + prepared for you + from the foundation of the world.
35For + I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you + gave me drink, + I was a stranger and you welcomed me,
36+ I was naked and you clothed me, + I was sick and you + visited me, + I was in prison and you came to me.’
37Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?
38And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you?
39And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’
40And + the King will answer them, + ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these + my brothers,+ you did it to me.’
41“Then he will say to those on his left, + ‘Depart from me, you + cursed, into + the eternal fire prepared for + the devil and his angels.
42For + I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink,
43I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’
44Then they also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?’
45Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, + you did not do it to me.’
46And these will go away + into eternal punishment, but the righteous + into + eternal life.”
