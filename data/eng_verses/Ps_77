1I + cry aloud to God,
2+ In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord;
3When I remember God, I + moan;
4You hold my eyelids open;
5I consider + the days of old,
6I said,+  “Let me remember my + song in the night;
7“Will the Lord + spurn forever,
8Has his steadfast love forever ceased?
9+ Has God forgotten to be gracious?
10Then I said, “I will appeal to this,
11I will remember the deeds of the Lord;
12I will ponder all your + work,
13Your way, O God, is + holy.
14You are the God who + works wonders;
15You + with your arm redeemed your people,
16When + the waters saw you, O God,
17The clouds poured out water;
18+ The crash of your thunder was in the whirlwind;
19Your + way was through the sea,
20You + led your people like a flock
