1+ Righteous are you, O Lord,
2You plant them, and they take root;
3+ But you, O Lord, know me;
4+ How long will the land mourn
5“If you have raced with men on foot, and they have wearied you,
6For + even your brothers and the house of your father,
7“I have forsaken my house;
8+ My heritage has become to me
9Is + my heritage to me like + a hyena’s lair?
10Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard;
11They have made it a desolation;
12Upon all the bare heights in the desert
13+ They have sown wheat and have reaped thorns;
14Thus says the Lord concerning all + my evil neighbors + who touch the heritage that + I have given my people Israel to inherit: “Behold, I will pluck them up from their land, and I will pluck up the house of Judah from among them. 
15And after I have plucked them up, I will again have compassion on them, + and I will bring them again each to his heritage and each to his land. 
16And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, + to swear by my name, ‘As the Lord lives,’ even as they taught my people to swear by Baal, + then they shall be built up in the midst of my people. 
17+ But if any nation will not listen, then I will utterly pluck it up and destroy it, declares the Lord.”
