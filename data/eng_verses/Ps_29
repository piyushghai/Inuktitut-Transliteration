1Ascribe to the Lord, O heavenly beings,+ 
2Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name;
3The voice of the Lord is over + the waters;
4The voice of the Lord is + powerful;
5The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars;
6He makes Lebanon to + skip like a calf,
7The voice of the Lord flashes forth flames of fire.
8The voice of the Lord shakes the wilderness;
9The voice of the Lord makes + the deer give birth+ 
10The Lord sits enthroned over + the flood;
11May the Lord give + strength to his people!
