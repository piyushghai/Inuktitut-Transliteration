1And David spoke + to the Lord the words of this song on the day when the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul. 
2+ He said,
3+ my+  God, my rock, + in whom I take refuge,
4I call upon the Lord, who is + worthy to be praised,
5+ “For the waves of death encompassed me,
6+ the cords of Sheol entangled me;
7+ “In my distress I called upon the Lord;
8“Then + the earth reeled and rocked;
9Smoke went up from his nostrils,+ 
10+ He bowed the heavens and + came down;
11He rode on a cherub and flew;
12He made + darkness around him + his canopy,
13Out of the brightness before him
14+ The Lord thundered from heaven,
15And he sent out + arrows and scattered them;
16Then the channels of the sea were seen;
17+ “He sent from on high, he took me;
18He rescued me from my strong enemy,
19They confronted me in the day of my calamity,
20+ He brought me out into a broad place;
21“The Lord + dealt with me according to my righteousness;
22+ For I have kept the ways of the Lord
23+ For all his rules were before me,
24I was + blameless before him,
25+ And the Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness,
26+ “With the merciful you show yourself merciful;
27with the purified you deal purely,
28+ You save a humble people,
29+ For you are my lamp, O Lord,
30For by you I can run against a troop,
31This God—+ his way is perfect;
32“For who is God, but the Lord?
33This God is my + strong refuge
34+ He made my feet like the feet of a deer
35+ He trains my hands for war,
36You have given me the shield of your salvation,
37+ You gave a wide place for my steps under me,
38I pursued my enemies and destroyed them,
39I consumed them; I thrust them through, so that they did not rise;
40For you equipped me with strength for the battle;
41You + made my enemies turn their backs to me,+ 
42They looked, but there was none to save;
43I beat them fine + as the dust of the earth;
44“You delivered me from strife with my people;+ 
45Foreigners came cringing to me;
46Foreigners lost heart
47“The Lord lives, and blessed be my rock,
48the God who gave me vengeance
49who brought me out from my enemies;
50+ “For this I will praise you, O Lord, among the nations,
51+ Great salvation he brings+  to his king,
