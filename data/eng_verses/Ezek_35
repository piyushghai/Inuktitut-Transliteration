1The word of the Lord came to me: 
2+ “Son of man, + set your face + against + Mount Seir, and prophesy against it, 
3and say to it, Thus says the Lord God: + Behold, I am against you, Mount Seir, and + I will stretch out my hand against you, + and I will make you a desolation and a waste. 
4+ I will lay your cities waste, and you shall become a desolation, and you shall know that I am the Lord. 
5Because + you cherished perpetual enmity and gave over the people of Israel to the power of the sword + at the time of their calamity, + at the time of their final punishment, 
6therefore, + as I live, declares the Lord God, I will prepare you for blood, and blood shall pursue you; + because you did not hate bloodshed, therefore blood shall pursue you. 
7+ I will make Mount Seir a waste + and a desolation, and I will cut off from it + all who come and go. 
8And I will fill + its mountains with the slain. On your hills and in your valleys and in all + your ravines + those slain with the sword shall fall. 
9+ I will make you a perpetual desolation, and + your cities shall not be inhabited. Then + you will know that I am the Lord.
10“Because you said, + ‘These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and + we will take possession of them’—although the + Lord was there— 
11therefore, + as I live, declares the Lord God, I will deal with you + according to the anger and + envy that you showed because of your hatred against them. And + I will make myself known among them, when I judge you. 
12And you shall know that I am the Lord.
13And + you magnified yourselves against me + with your mouth, and multiplied your words against me; I heard it. 
14Thus says the Lord God: + While the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate. 
15As you + rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so I will deal with you; you shall be desolate, + Mount Seir, and all Edom, all of it. Then + they will know that I am the Lord.
