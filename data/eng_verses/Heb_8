1Now the point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest, + one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, 
2a minister in the holy places, in + the true tent+  that the Lord + set up, not man. 
3For + every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; thus + it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer. 
4Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law. 
5They serve + a copy and + shadow of the heavenly things. For when Moses was about to erect the tent, he was instructed by God, saying, + “See that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain.” 
6But as it is, Christ+  has obtained a ministry that is + as much more excellent than the old as + the covenant + he mediates is better, since it is enacted on better promises. 
7+ For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion to look for a second.
8For he finds fault with them when he says:+ 
9not like the covenant that I made with their fathers
10+ For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel
11And they shall not teach, each one his neighbor
12For I will be merciful toward their iniquities,
13In speaking of a new covenant, he makes the first one obsolete. And + what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.
