1The + oracle concerning + the valley of vision.
2you who are full of shoutings,
3+ All your leaders have fled together;
4Therefore I said:
5+ For the Lord God of hosts has + a day
6And + Elam bore the quiver
7Your choicest valleys were full of chariots,
8He has taken away + the covering of Judah.
9and you saw that + the breaches of the city of David were many. + You collected the waters of the lower pool, 
10and you counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall. 
11+ You made a reservoir between + the two walls for the water of + the old pool. But + you did not look to him who did it, or see him who planned it long ago.
12In that day + the Lord God of hosts
13and behold, joy and gladness,
14The Lord of hosts + has revealed himself in my ears:
15Thus says the Lord God of hosts, “Come, go to this steward, to + Shebna, who is over the household, and say to him: 
16What have you to do here, and whom have you here, + that you have cut out here a tomb for yourself, you + who cut out a tomb on the height and carve a dwelling for yourself in the rock? 
17Behold, the Lord will hurl you away violently, O you strong man. + He will seize firm hold on you 
18and whirl you around and around, and throw you like a ball into a wide land. There you shall die, and there shall be + your glorious chariots, you shame of your master’s house. 
19+ I will thrust you from your office, and you will be pulled down from your station. 
20In that day I will call my servant + Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, 
21and + I will clothe him with your robe, and will bind your sash on him, and will commit your authority to his hand. And he shall be + a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. 
22And I will place + on his shoulder + the key of the house of David. + He shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open. 
23And I will fasten him + like a peg in a secure place, and he will become + a throne of honor to his father’s house. 
24And they will hang on him the whole honor of his father’s house, the offspring and issue, every small vessel, from the cups to all the flagons. 
25In that day, declares the Lord of hosts, + the peg that was fastened in a secure place will give way, and it will be cut down and fall, and the load that was on it will be cut off, for the Lord has spoken.”
