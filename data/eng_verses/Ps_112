1+ + Praise the Lord!
2His + offspring will be mighty in the land;
3+ Wealth and riches are in his house,
4Light dawns in the darkness + for the upright;
5It is well with the man who + deals generously and lends;
6For the righteous will + never be moved;
7He is not + afraid of bad news;
8His heart is steady; he will not be afraid,
9He has + distributed freely; he has given to the poor;
10The wicked man sees it and is angry;
