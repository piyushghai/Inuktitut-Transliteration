1Lord, you have been our + dwelling place+ 
2+ Before the + mountains were brought forth,
3You return man to dust
4For + a thousand years in your sight
5You + sweep them away as with a flood; they are like + a dream,
6in + the morning it flourishes and is renewed;
7For we are brought to an end by your anger;
8You have + set our iniquities before you,
9For all our days pass away under your wrath;
10The years of our life are seventy,
11Who considers the power of your anger,
12+ So teach us to number our days
13+ Return, O Lord! + How long?
14Satisfy us in the + morning with your steadfast love,
15Make us glad for as many days as you have + afflicted us,
16Let your + work be shown to your servants,
17Let the + favor+  of the Lord our God be upon us,
