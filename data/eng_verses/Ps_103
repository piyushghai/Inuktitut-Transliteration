2+ Bless the Lord, O my soul,
3who + forgives all your iniquity,
4who + redeems your life from the pit,
5who + satisfies you with good
6The Lord works + righteousness
7He made known his + ways to Moses,
8The Lord is + merciful and gracious,
9+ He will not always chide,
10He does not deal with us + according to our sins,
11For + as high as the heavens are above the earth,
12as far as the east is from the west,
13As + a father shows compassion to his children,
14For he knows our frame;+ 
15As for man, his days are like + grass;
16for + the wind passes over it, and + it is gone,
17But + the steadfast love of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting on + those who fear him,
18to those who + keep his covenant
19The Lord has + established his throne in the heavens,
20Bless the Lord, O you + his angels,
21Bless the Lord, all his + hosts,
22+ Bless the Lord, all his works,
