1The word of the Lord came to me: 
2+ “Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord God:
3+ For the day is near,
4+ A sword shall come upon Egypt,
5+ Cush, and + Put, and Lud, and + all Arabia, and Libya,+  and the people of the land that is in league,+  shall fall with them by the sword.
6“Thus says the Lord:
7+ And they shall be desolated in the midst of desolated countries,
8+ Then they will know that I am the Lord,
9“On that day + messengers shall go out from me in ships to terrify the unsuspecting + people of Cush, and + anguish shall come upon them on the day of Egypt’s doom;+  for, behold, it comes!
10“Thus says the Lord God:
11He and his people with him, + the most ruthless of nations,
12And + I will + dry up the Nile
13“Thus says the Lord God:
14I will make + Pathros a desolation
15And I will pour out my wrath on Pelusium,
16And I will set fire to Egypt;
17The young men of On and of Pi-beseth shall fall by the sword,
18At + Tehaphnehes + the day shall be dark,
19Thus + I will execute judgments on Egypt.
20+ In the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me: 
21+ “Son of man, + I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and behold, + it has not been bound up, to heal it by binding it with a bandage, so that it may become strong to wield the sword. 
22Therefore thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt and + will break his arms, both the strong arm and the one that was broken, and I will make the sword fall from his hand. 
23+ I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them through the countries. 
24And + I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put + my sword in his hand, but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he will groan before him + like a man mortally wounded. 
25I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, but the arms of Pharaoh shall fall. + Then they shall know that I am the Lord, + when I put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and he stretches it out against the land of Egypt. 
26And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them throughout the countries. Then they will know that I am the Lord.”
