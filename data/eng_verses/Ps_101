1I will sing of + steadfast love and justice;
2I will + ponder the way + that is blameless.
3I will not set before my eyes
4+ A perverse heart shall be far from me;
5Whoever slanders his neighbor + secretly
6I will look with favor on the faithful in the land,
7No one who + practices deceit
8+ Morning by morning I will destroy
