1+ Cast your bread upon the waters,
2+ Give a portion to + seven, or even to eight,
3If the clouds are full of rain,
4He who observes the wind will not sow,
5As you do not know the way + the spirit comes to + the bones in the womb+  of a woman with child, so you do not know the work of God who makes everything.
6In the morning sow your seed, and at evening + withhold not your hand, for you do not know which will prosper, this or that, or whether both alike will be good.
7Light is sweet, and it is pleasant for the eyes to + see the sun.
8So if a person lives many years, let him rejoice in them all; but let him remember + that the days of darkness will be many. All that comes is + vanity.+ 
9+ Rejoice, O young man, in your youth, and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth. + Walk in the ways of your heart and + the sight of your eyes. But know that for all these things + God will bring you into judgment.
10Remove vexation from your heart, and + put away pain+  from your body, for youth and the dawn of life are vanity.
