1Do not boast about tomorrow,
2Let + another praise you, and not your own mouth;
3A stone is heavy, and sand is weighty,
4Wrath is cruel, anger is overwhelming,
5+ Better is open rebuke
6Faithful are + the wounds of a friend;
7One who is full loathes + honey,
8Like + a bird that strays from its nest
9+ Oil and perfume make the heart glad,
10Do not forsake your friend and + your father’s friend,
11+ Be wise, + my son, and + make my heart glad,
12+ The prudent sees danger and hides himself,
13+ Take a man’s garment when he has put up security for a stranger,
14Whoever blesses his neighbor with a loud voice,
15+ A continual dripping on a rainy day
16to restrain her is to restrain the wind
17Iron sharpens iron,
18+ Whoever tends a fig tree will eat its fruit,
19As in water face reflects face,
20+ Sheol and Abaddon are + never satisfied,
21+ The crucible is for silver, and the furnace is for gold,
22+ Crush a fool in a mortar with a pestle
23+ Know well the condition of your flocks,
24for + riches do not last forever;
25+ When the grass is gone and the new growth appears
26+ the lambs will provide your clothing,
27+ There will be enough goats’ milk for your food,
