1Thus says the Lord:
2+ Why, when I came, was there no man;
3+ I clothe the heavens with blackness
4The Lord God has given + me
5+ The Lord God has opened my ear,
6+ I gave my back to those who strike,
7But the Lord God helps me;
8+ He who vindicates me is near.
9+ Behold, the Lord God helps me;
10Who among you fears the Lord
11Behold, all you who kindle a fire,
