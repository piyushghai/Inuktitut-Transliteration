1Then Job answered and said:
2â€œHow you have + helped him who has no power!
3How you have + counseled him who has no wisdom,
4With whose help have you uttered words,
5The + dead tremble
6Sheol is + naked before God,+ 
7He + stretches out the north over + the void
8He + binds up the waters in his thick clouds,
9He covers the face of the full moon+ 
10He has inscribed + a circle on the face of the waters
11+ The pillars of heaven tremble
12By his power he + stilled the sea;
13+ By his wind the heavens were made fair;
14Behold, these are but the outskirts of his + ways,
