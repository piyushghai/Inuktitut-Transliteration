1Then he showed me + Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and + Satan+  standing at his right hand to accuse him. 
2And the Lord said to Satan, + “The Lord rebuke you, O Satan! The Lord who has + chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is not this + a brand+  plucked from the fire?” 
3Now + Joshua was standing before the angel, + clothed with filthy garments. 
4And the angel said to + those who were standing before him, + “Remove the filthy garments from him.” And to him he said, “Behold, + I have taken your iniquity away from you, and + I will clothe you with pure vestments.” 
5And I said, + “Let them put a clean turban on his head.” So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the Lord was standing by.
6And the angel of the Lord solemnly assured + Joshua, 
7“Thus says the Lord of hosts: If you will walk in my ways and + keep my charge, then you shall + rule my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you the right of access among + those who are standing here. 
8Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who sit before you, for + they are men who are a sign: behold, I will bring + my servant + the Branch. 
9For behold, on + the stone that I have set before Joshua, on a single stone with + seven eyes,+  I will + engrave its inscription, declares the Lord of hosts, and + I will remove the iniquity of this land in a single day. 
10In that day, declares the Lord of hosts, every one of you will invite his neighbor to come + under his vine and under his fig tree.”
