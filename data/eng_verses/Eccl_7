1+ A good name is better than precious ointment,
2It is better to go to the house of mourning
3Sorrow is better than laughter,
4The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning,
5It is + better for a man to hear the rebuke of the wise
6+ For as the crackling of + thorns under a pot,
7Surely + oppression drives the wise into madness,
8Better is the end of a thing than its beginning,
9+ Be not quick in your spirit to become angry,
10Say not, “Why were the former days better than these?”
11Wisdom is good with an inheritance,
12For the protection of wisdom is like + the protection of money,
13Consider + the work of God:
14+ In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider: God has made the one as well as the other, + so that man may not find out anything that will be after him.
15In my + vain+  life I have seen everything. There is + a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who + prolongs his life in his evildoing. 
16Be not overly righteous, and do not + make yourself too wise. Why should you destroy yourself? 
17Be not overly wicked, neither be a fool. + Why should you die before your time? 
18It is good that you should take hold of + this, and from + that + withhold not your hand, for the one who fears God shall come out from both of them.
19+ Wisdom gives strength to the wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city.
20Surely + there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and never sins.
21Do not take to heart all the things that people say, lest you hear + your servant cursing you. 
22Your heart knows that + many times you yourself have cursed others.
23All this I have tested by wisdom. + I said, “I will be wise,” but it was far from me. 
24That which has been is far off, and + deep, very deep; + who can find it out?
25+ I turned my heart to know and to search out and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things, and to know the wickedness of folly and the foolishness that is madness. 
26And I find something more + bitter than death: + the woman whose heart is + snares and nets, and whose hands are fetters. He who pleases God escapes her, but + the sinner is taken by her. 
27Behold, this is what I found, says + the Preacher, while adding one thing to another to find the scheme of things— 
28which my soul has sought repeatedly, but I have not found. + One man among a thousand I found, but + a woman among all these I have not found. 
29See, this alone I found, that + God made man upright, but + they have sought out many schemes.
