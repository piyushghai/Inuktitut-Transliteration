1The vision of Obadiah.
2Behold, I will make you small among the nations;
3+ The pride of your heart has deceived you,
4Though you soar aloft like the eagle,
5If + thieves came to you,
6+ How Esau has been pillaged,
7All your allies have driven you to your border;
8+ Will I not on that day, declares the Lord,
9And your mighty men shall be dismayed, + O Teman,
10+ Because of the violence done to your brother Jacob,
11+ On the day that you stood aloof,
12+ But do not gloat over the day of your brother
13+ Do not enter the gate of my people
14+ Do not stand at the crossroads
15For + the day of the Lord is near upon all the nations.
16+ For as you have drunk on + my holy mountain,
17+ But in Mount Zion there shall be those who escape,
18+ The house of Jacob shall be a fire,
19Those of + the Negeb + shall possess + Mount Esau,
20The exiles of this host of the people of Israel
21+ Saviors shall go up to Mount Zion
