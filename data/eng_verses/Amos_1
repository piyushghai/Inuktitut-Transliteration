4+ So I will send a fire upon the house of + Hazael,
5I will + break the gate-bar of + Damascus,
6Thus says the Lord:
7So I will send a fire upon the wall of + Gaza,
8I will cut off the inhabitants from + Ashdod,
9Thus says the Lord:
10So I will send a fire upon the wall of + Tyre,
11Thus says the Lord:
12So I will send a fire upon + Teman,
13Thus says the Lord:
14So I will kindle a fire in the wall of + Rabbah,
15and + their king shall go into exile,
