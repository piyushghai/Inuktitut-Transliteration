1+ In the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me: 
2+ “Son of man, write down the name of this day, this very day. The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day. 
3And + utter a parable to + the rebellious house and say to them, Thus says the Lord God:
4put in it the pieces of meat,
5Take the choicest one of the flock;
6“Therefore thus says the Lord God: + Woe to the bloody city, to + the pot whose corrosion is in it, and whose corrosion has not gone out of it! Take out of it piece after piece, without making any choice.+ 
7For the blood she has shed is in her midst; she put it on + the bare rock; + she did not pour it out on the ground to cover it with dust. 
8To rouse my wrath, to take vengeance, I have set on the bare rock the blood she has shed, that it may not be covered. 
9Therefore thus says the Lord God: Woe to the bloody city! + I also will make the pile great. 
10Heap on the logs, kindle the fire, boil the meat well, mix in the spices,+  and let the bones be burned up. 
11Then set it empty upon the coals, that it may become hot, and its copper may burn, + that its uncleanness may be melted in it, its corrosion consumed. 
12+ She has wearied herself with toil;+  its abundant corrosion does not go out of it. Into the fire with its corrosion! 
13On account of your unclean lewdness, because I would have cleansed you and you were not cleansed from your uncleanness, + you shall not be cleansed anymore till + I have satisfied my fury upon you. 
14+ I am the Lord. I have spoken; it shall come to pass; I will do it. I will not go back; + I will not spare; + I will not relent; + according to your ways and your deeds you will be judged, declares the Lord God.”
15The word of the Lord came to me: 
16+ “Son of man, behold, I am about to take the delight of your eyes away from you at a stroke; yet you shall not mourn or weep, nor shall your tears run down. 
17Sigh, but not aloud; make no mourning for the dead. + Bind on your turban, and + put your shoes on your feet; do not cover your lips, + nor eat the bread of men.” 
18So I spoke to the people in the morning, and + at evening my wife died. And on the next morning I did + as I was commanded.
19And + the people said to me, “Will you not tell us what these things mean for us, that you are acting thus?” 
20Then I said to them, “The word of the Lord came to me: 
21‘Say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord God: + Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the delight of your eyes, and the yearning of your soul, and + your sons and your daughters whom you left behind shall fall by the sword. 
22And + you shall do as I have done; + you shall not cover your lips, + nor eat the bread of men. 
23+ Your turbans shall be on your heads and your shoes on your feet; you shall not mourn or weep, but + you shall rot away in your iniquities and groan to one another. 
24Thus shall Ezekiel be to you + a sign; + according to all that he has done you shall do. When this comes, then + you will know that I am the Lord God.’
25“As for you, + son of man, surely on the day when I take from them + their stronghold, their joy and glory, the delight of their eyes and their soul’s desire, and also their sons and daughters, 
26+ on that day a fugitive will come to you to report to you the news. 
27On that day your mouth + will be opened to the fugitive, and you shall speak and be no longer mute. + So you will be a sign to them, and + they will know that I am the Lord.”
