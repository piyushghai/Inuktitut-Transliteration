1Thus says the Lord:
2So I will send a fire upon Moab,
3+ I will cut off the ruler from its midst,
4Thus says the Lord:
5So + I will send a fire upon Judah,
6Thus says the Lord:
7those who trample the head of the poor + into the dust of the earth
8they lay themselves down beside every altar
9“Yet + it was I who destroyed the Amorite before them,
10+ Also it was I who brought you up out of the land of Egypt
11And I raised up some of your sons for prophets,
12“But you made the Nazirites + drink wine,
13“Behold, I will press you down in your place,
14+ Flight shall perish from the swift,
15he who handles the bow shall not stand,
16and he who is stout of heart among the mighty
