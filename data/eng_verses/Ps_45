1My heart overflows with a pleasing theme;
2You are + the most handsome of the sons of men;
3+ Gird your + sword on your thigh, O + mighty one,
4In your majesty + ride out victoriously
5Your arrows are sharp
6+ Your throne, O God, is forever and ever.
7+ you have loved righteousness and hated wickedness.
8your robes are all fragrant with + myrrh and aloes and cassia.
9daughters of kings are among your ladies of honor;
10Hear, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear:
11and the king will desire your beauty.
12The people+  of Tyre will + seek your favor with + gifts,
13All glorious is + the princess in her chamber, with robes interwoven with gold.
14+ In many-colored robes + she is led to the king,
15With joy and gladness they are led along
16In place of your fathers shall be your sons;
17+ I will cause your name to be remembered in all generations;
