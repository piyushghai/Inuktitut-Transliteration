1My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, + we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. 
2+ He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but + also for the sins of the whole world. 
3And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we + keep his commandments. 
4Whoever says “I know him” but does not keep his commandments + is a liar, and + the truth is not in him, 
5but whoever + keeps his word, in him truly + the love of God is perfected. + By this we may know that we are in him: 
6whoever says he + abides in him + ought to walk in the same way in which he walked.
7Beloved, I am writing you + no new commandment, but + an old commandment + that you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that you have heard. 
8At the same time, it is + a new commandment that I am writing to you, which is true in him and in you, because+ + the darkness is passing away and + the true light is already shining. 
9Whoever says he is in the light and + hates his brother is still in darkness. 
10Whoever loves his brother abides in the light, and in him+  there is no + cause for stumbling. 
11But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and + walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
12I am writing to you, little children,
13I am writing to you, fathers,
14I write to you, fathers,
15+ Do not love the world or the things in the world. + If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 
16For all that is in the world—+ the desires of the flesh and + the desires of the eyes and pride of life+ —is not from the Father but is from the world. 
17And + the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.
18Children, + it is the last hour, and as you have heard that + antichrist is coming, so now + many antichrists have come. + Therefore we know that it is the last hour. 
19+ They went out from us, but they were not of us; for + if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, + that it might become plain that they all are not of us. 
20But you have been + anointed by + the Holy One, and + you all have knowledge.+ 
21I write to you, not because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth. 
22Who is the liar but + he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is + the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son. 
23+ No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also. 
24Let + what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then + you too will abide in the Son and in the Father. 
25And this is the promise that he made to us+ —+ eternal life.
26I write these things to you about + those who are trying to deceive you. 
27But + the anointing that you received from him abides in you, and + you have no need that anyone should teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about everything, and + is true, and is no lie—just as it has taught you, abide in him.
28And now, little children, abide in him, so that + when he appears + we may have confidence and not shrink from him in shame at his + coming. 
29If you know that + he is righteous, you may be sure that + everyone who practices righteousness has been born of him.
