1+ The Lord reigns, + let the earth rejoice;
2+ Clouds and thick darkness are all around him;
3+ Fire goes before him
4His + lightnings light up the world;
5The mountains + melt like + wax before the Lord,
6+ The heavens proclaim his righteousness,
7All worshipers of images are + put to shame,
8Zion hears and + is glad,
9For you, O Lord, are + most high over all the earth;
10O you who love the Lord, + hate evil!
11+ Light + is sown+  for the righteous,
12+ Rejoice in the Lord, O you righteous,
