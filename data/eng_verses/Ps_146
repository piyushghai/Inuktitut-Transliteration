1+ Praise the Lord!
2I will praise the Lord+ as long as I live;
3+ Put not your trust in princes,
4When + his breath departs, he returns to the earth;
5+ Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob,
6+ who made heaven and earth,
7+ who executes justice for the oppressed,
8+ the Lord opens the eyes of the blind.
9+ The Lord watches over the sojourners;
10+ The Lord will reign forever,
