1In the days of + Ahaz the son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, + Rezin the king of Syria and + Pekah the son of Remaliah the king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to wage war against it, but could not yet mount an attack against it. 
2When the house of David was told, + “Syria is in league with+ + Ephraim,” the heart of Ahaz+  and the heart of his people shook as the trees of the forest shake before the wind.
3And the Lord said to Isaiah, “Go out to meet Ahaz, you and + Shear-jashub+  your son, at the end of + the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Washer’s Field. 
4And say to him, + ‘Be careful, + be quiet, do not fear, and do not let your heart be faint because of these two + smoldering stumps of firebrands, at the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria and + the son of Remaliah. 
5Because Syria, with Ephraim and + the son of Remaliah, has devised evil against you, saying, 
6“Let us go up against Judah and terrify it, and let us conquer it+  for ourselves, and set up the son of Tabeel as king in the midst of it,” 
7thus says the Lord God:
8For the head of Syria is + Damascus,
9And the head of Ephraim is Samaria,
10Again the Lord spoke to Ahaz, 
11“Ask + a sign of the Lord your+  God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven.” 
12But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, and I will not put the Lord to the test.” 
13And he+  said, “Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men, that you + weary my God also? 
14Therefore the + Lord himself will give you a sign. + Behold, the + virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name + Immanuel.+ 
15He shall eat + curds and honey when he knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good. 
16+ For before the boy knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land whose two kings you dread will be + deserted. 
17+ The Lord will bring upon you and upon your people and upon your father’s house such days as have not come since the day that + Ephraim departed from Judah—the king of Assyria.”
18In that day the Lord will + whistle for the fly that is at the end of the streams of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria. 
19And they will all come and settle in the steep ravines, and + in the clefts of the rocks, and on all the thornbushes, and on all the pastures.+ 
20In that day + the Lord will + shave with a razor that is + hired beyond + the River—with the king of Assyria—the head and the hair of the feet, and it will sweep away the beard also.
21+ In that day a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep, 
22and because of the abundance of milk that they give, he will eat curds, for everyone who is left in the land will eat + curds and honey.
23In that day every place where there used to be a thousand vines, worth a thousand shekels+  of silver, will become + briers and thorns. 
24+ With bow and arrows a man will come there, for all the land will be briers and thorns. 
25+ And as for all the hills that used to be hoed with a hoe, you will not come there for fear + of briers and thorns, but they will become a place where cattle are let loose and where sheep tread.
