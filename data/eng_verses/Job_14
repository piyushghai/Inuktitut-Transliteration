1“Man who is + born of a woman
2He comes out like + a flower and + withers;
3And do you + open your eyes on such a one
4Who can bring + a clean thing out of an unclean?
5Since his + days are determined,
6+ look away from him and leave him alone,+ 
7“For there is hope for a tree,
8Though its root grow old in the earth,
9yet at the scent of water it will bud
10But a man dies and is laid low;
11+ As waters fail from a lake
12so a man lies down and rises not again;
13Oh that you would + hide me in + Sheol,
14If a man dies, shall he live again?
15You would + call, and I would answer you;
16For then you would + number my steps;
17my transgression would be + sealed up in a bag,
18“But the mountain falls and + crumbles away,
19the waters wear away the stones;
20You prevail forever against him, and he passes;
21His sons come to honor, and he + does not know it;
22He feels only the pain of his own body,
