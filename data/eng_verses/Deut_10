1“At that time the Lord said to me, + ‘Cut for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, and come up to me on the mountain and + make an ark of wood. 
2And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets that you broke, and + you shall put them in the ark.’ 
3So I made an ark + of acacia wood, and + cut two tablets of stone like the first, and went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hand. 
4And + he wrote on the tablets, in the same writing as before, the Ten Commandments+ + that the Lord had spoken to you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire + on the day of the assembly. And the Lord gave them to me. 
5Then I turned and + came down from the mountain and + put the tablets in the ark that I had made. + And there they are, as the Lord commanded me.”
6(The people of Israel + journeyed from Beeroth Bene-jaakan+  to Moserah. + There Aaron died, and there he was buried. And his son Eleazar ministered as priest in his place. 
7+ From there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land with brooks of water. 
8At that time + the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi + to carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord + to stand before the Lord to minister to him and + to bless in his name, to this day. 
9+ Therefore Levi has no portion or inheritance with his brothers. The Lord is his inheritance, as the Lord your God said to him.)
10+ “I myself stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights, + and the Lord listened to me that time also. The Lord was unwilling to destroy you. 
11+ And the Lord said to me, ‘Arise, go on your journey at the head of the people, so that they may go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give them.’
12“And now, Israel, + what does the Lord your God require of you, but + to fear the Lord your God, + to walk in all his ways, + to love him, to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, 
13and + to keep the commandments and statutes of the Lord, which I am commanding you today + for your good? 
14Behold, + to the Lord your God belong heaven and the heaven of heavens, + the earth with all that is in it. 
15Yet + the Lord set his heart in love on your fathers and chose their offspring after them, you above all peoples, as you are this day. 
16Circumcise therefore + the foreskin of your heart, and be no longer + stubborn. 
17For the Lord your God is + God of gods and + Lord of lords, + the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who is + not partial and takes no bribe. 
18+ He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, giving him food and clothing. 
19+ Love the sojourner, therefore, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt. 
20+ You shall fear the Lord your God. You shall serve him and + hold fast to him, and + by his name you shall swear. 
21+ He is your praise. He is your God, + who has done for you these great and terrifying things that your eyes have seen. 
22Your fathers went down to Egypt + seventy persons, and now the Lord your God has made you + as numerous as the stars of heaven.
