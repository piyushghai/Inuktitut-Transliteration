1Give the king your + justice, O God,
2May he + judge your people with righteousness,
3Let the mountains bear + prosperity for the people,
4May he defend the cause of the poor of the people,
5May they fear you+  while + the sun endures,
6May he be like + rain that falls on + the mown grass,
7In his days may + the righteous flourish,
8May he have dominion from + sea to sea,
9May desert tribes + bow down before him,
10May the kings of + Tarshish and of + the coastlands
11May all kings + fall down before him,
12For he delivers + the needy when he calls,
13He has pity on the weak and the needy,
14From oppression and violence he redeems their life,
15Long may he live;
16May there be abundance of grain in the land;
17+ May his name endure forever,
18+ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,
19Blessed be his + glorious name forever;
20+ The prayers of + David, the son of Jesse, are ended.
