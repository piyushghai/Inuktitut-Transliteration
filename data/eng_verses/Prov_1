1+ The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:
2To know wisdom and instruction,
3to receive instruction in wise dealing,
4to give prudence to + the simple,
5Let the wise hear and + increase in learning,
6to understand a proverb and a saying,
7+ The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge;
8+ Hear, my son, your father’s instruction,
9for they are + a graceful garland for your head
10My son, if sinners + entice you,
11If they say, “Come with us, + let us lie in wait for blood;
12like Sheol let us + swallow them alive,
13we shall find all precious goods,
14throw in your lot among us;
15my son, + do not walk in the way with them;
16for + their feet run to evil,
17+ For in vain is a net spread
18but these men + lie in wait for their own blood;
19+ Such are the ways of everyone who is + greedy for unjust gain;
20+ Wisdom cries aloud in the street,
21at the head of the noisy streets she cries out;
22“How long, O + simple ones, will you love being simple?
23If you turn at my reproof,+ 
24+ Because I have called and + you refused to listen,
25because you have + ignored all my counsel
26I also + will laugh at your calamity;
27when terror strikes you like + a storm
28+ Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer;
29Because they + hated knowledge
30+ would have none of my counsel
31therefore they shall eat + the fruit of their way,
32For the simple are killed by + their turning away,
33but + whoever listens to me will dwell secure
