1I was glad when they said to me,
2Our feet have been standing
3Jerusalem—+ built as a city
4to which the tribes + go up,
5There + thrones for judgment were set,
6+ Pray for the peace of Jerusalem!
7Peace be within your + walls
8For my brothers and companions’ sake
9For the sake of the house of the Lord our God,
