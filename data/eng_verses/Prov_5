1+ My son, be attentive to my wisdom;
2that you may keep + discretion,
3For the lips of + a forbidden+  woman drip honey,
4but in the end she is + bitter as + wormwood,
5Her feet + go down to death;
6she + does not ponder the path of life;
7And + now, O sons, listen to me,
8Keep your way far from her,
9lest you give your honor to others
10lest strangers take their fill of your strength,
11and at the end of your life you + groan,
12and you say, + “How I hated discipline,
13I did not listen to the voice of my teachers
14+ I am at the brink of utter ruin
15Drink + water from your own cistern,
16Should your + springs be scattered abroad,
17+ Let them be for yourself alone,
18Let your + fountain be blessed,
19a lovely + deer, a graceful doe.
20Why should you be intoxicated, my son, with + a forbidden woman
21For + a man’s ways are + before the eyes of the Lord,
22The + iniquities of the wicked + ensnare him,
23+ He dies for lack of discipline,
