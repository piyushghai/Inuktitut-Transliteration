1+ My son, + if you receive my words
2making your ear attentive to wisdom
3yes, if you call out for insight
4if you seek it like + silver
5then + you will understand the fear of the Lord
6For + the Lord gives wisdom;
7he stores up sound wisdom for the upright;
8guarding the paths of justice
9+ Then you will understand + righteousness and justice
10for wisdom will come into your heart,
11+ discretion will + watch over you,
12delivering you from the way of evil,
13who forsake the paths of uprightness
14who + rejoice in doing evil
15men whose + paths are crooked,
16So + you will be delivered from the forbidden+  woman,
17who forsakes + the companion of her youth
18+ for her house sinks down to death,
19none who go to her come back,
20So you will walk in the way of the good
21For the upright + will inhabit the land,
22but the wicked will be + cut off from the land,
