1“The sin of Judah is written with + a pen of iron; with a point of diamond it is engraved on + the tablet of their heart, and on + the horns of their altars, 
2while + their children remember their altars and their + Asherim, + beside every green tree and on the high hills, 
3+ on the mountains in the open country. + Your wealth and all your treasures I will give for spoil as the price of your high places for sin throughout all your territory. 
4You shall loosen your hand from your heritage that I gave to you, + and I will make you serve your enemies in a land that you do not know, + for in my anger a fire is kindled that shall burn forever.”
5Thus says the Lord:
6+ He is like a shrub in the desert,
7+ “Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord,
8+ He is like a tree planted by water,
9The heart is deceitful above all things,
10+ “I the Lord search the heart
11Like the + partridge that gathers a brood that she did not hatch,
12A glorious throne set on high from the beginning
13O Lord, + the hope of Israel,
14+ Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed;
15+ Behold, they say to me,
16I have not run away from being your shepherd,
17Be not a terror to me;
18+ Let those be put to shame who persecute me,
19Thus said the Lord to me: “Go and stand in the People’s Gate, by which + the kings of Judah enter and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem, 
20and say: ‘Hear the word of the Lord, + you kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who enter by these gates. 
21Thus says the Lord: Take care for the sake of your lives, and + do not bear a burden on the Sabbath day or bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem. 
22And do not carry a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath + or do any work, but + keep the Sabbath day holy, as I commanded your fathers. 
23Yet + they did not listen or incline their ear, + but stiffened their neck, that they + might not hear and receive instruction.
24“‘But if you listen to me, declares the Lord, and + bring in no burden by the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, but + keep the Sabbath day holy and do no work on it, 
25then + there shall enter by the gates of this city kings and princes who sit on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their officials, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And this city shall be inhabited forever. 
26And people shall come from + the cities of Judah + and the places around Jerusalem, + from the land of Benjamin, + from the Shephelah, from the hill country, + and from + the Negeb, bringing + burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain offerings and frankincense, and + bringing thank offerings to the house of the Lord. 
27But if you do not listen to me, to + keep the Sabbath day holy, + and not to bear a burden and enter by the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will + kindle a fire in its gates, and it shall + devour the palaces of Jerusalem and + shall not be quenched.’”
