1+ Blow a trumpet in + Zion;
2+ a day of darkness and gloom,
3+ Fire devours before them,
4+ Their appearance is like the appearance of horses,
5+ As with the rumbling of chariots,
6Before them peoples are in anguish;
7Like warriors they charge;
8They do not jostle one another;
9+ They leap upon the city,
10+ The earth quakes before them;
11+ The Lord utters his voice
12“Yet even now,” declares the Lord,
13and + rend your hearts and not + your garments.”
14+ Who knows whether he will not turn and relent,
15+ Blow the trumpet in Zion;
16gather the people.
17+ Between the + vestibule and the + altar
18+ Then the Lord became jealous for his land
19The Lord answered and said to his people,
20“I will remove the northerner far from you,
21“Fear not, O land;
22Fear not, + you beasts of the field,
23+ “Be glad, O children of Zion,
24“The threshing floors shall be full of grain;
25I will restore+  to you the years
26+ “You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied,
27+ You shall know that I am + in the midst of Israel,
28+ + “And it shall come to pass afterward,
29+ Even on the male and female servants
30“And I will show + wonders in the heavens and + on the earth, blood and fire and columns of smoke. 
31+ The sun shall be turned to darkness, + and the moon to blood, + before the great and awesome day of the Lord comes. 
32And it shall come to pass that + everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved. + For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those who escape, as the Lord has said, and among + the survivors shall be those whom the Lord calls.
