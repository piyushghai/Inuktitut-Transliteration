1+ If it had not been the Lord who was on our sideâ€”
2if it had not been the Lord who was on our side
3then they would have + swallowed us up alive,
4then + the flood would have + swept us away,
5then over us would have gone
6Blessed be the Lord,
7We have escaped like a bird
8+ Our help is in the name of the Lord,
