1When + the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in + the Negeb, heard that Israel was coming by the way of Atharim, he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive. 
2+ And Israel vowed a vow to the Lord and said, “If you will indeed give this people into my hand, then I will devote their cities to destruction.”+ 
3And the Lord heeded the voice of Israel and gave over the Canaanites, and they devoted them and their cities to destruction. So the name of the place was called + Hormah.+ 
4From Mount Hor + they set out by the way to the Red Sea, + to go around the land of Edom. And the people became impatient on the way. 
5And the people + spoke against God and against Moses, + “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and + we loathe this worthless food.” 
6+ Then the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and + they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died. 
7+ And the people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord and against you. + Pray to the Lord, that he take away the serpents from us.” So Moses prayed for the people. 
8And the Lord said to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent and set it on a pole, and everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.” 
9So + Moses made a bronze+  serpent and set it on a pole. And if a serpent bit anyone, he would look at the bronze serpent and live.
10And the people of Israel set out and + camped in Oboth. 
11+ And they set out from Oboth and + camped at Iye-abarim, in the wilderness that is opposite Moab, toward the sunrise. 
12From there they set out and camped in + the Valley of Zered. 
13From there they set out and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that extends from the border of the Amorites, for the + Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. 
14Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the Lord,
15and the slope of the valleys
16And from there they continued + to Beer;+  that is the well of which the Lord said to Moses, “Gather the people together, so that + I may give them water.” 
17Then Israel sang this song:
18the well that the princes made,
19and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth, 
20and from Bamoth to the valley lying in the region of Moab by the top of Pisgah + that looks down on the desert.+ 
21Then + Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, 
22+ “Let me pass through your land. We will not turn aside into field or vineyard. We will not drink the water of a well. We will go by the King’s Highway until we have passed through your territory.” 
23+ But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory. He gathered all his people together and went out against Israel to the wilderness and + came to Jahaz and fought against Israel. 
24+ And Israel defeated him with the edge of the sword and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the + Jabbok, as far as to the Ammonites, for the border of the Ammonites was strong. 
25And Israel took all these cities, and Israel settled in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages. 
26For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land out of his hand, as far as the Arnon. 
27Therefore the + ballad singers say,
28For + fire came out from + Heshbon,
29+ Woe to you, O Moab!
30So we overthrew them;
31Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites. 
32And Moses sent to spy out + Jazer, and they captured its villages and dispossessed the Amorites who were there. 
33Then they turned and went up by the way to Bashan. And Og the king of Bashan came out against them, he and all his people, to battle + at Edrei. 
34+ But the Lord said to Moses, “Do not fear him, for I have given him into your hand, and all his people, and his land. And + you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.” 
35So they defeated him and his sons and all his people, until he had no survivor left. And they possessed his land.
