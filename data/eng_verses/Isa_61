1+ The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me,
2+ to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor,
3to grant to those who mourn in Zion—
4+ They shall build up the ancient ruins;
5+ Strangers shall stand and tend your flocks;
6+ but you shall be called the priests of the Lord;
7+ Instead of your shame there shall be a double portion;
8+ For I the Lord love justice;
9Their offspring shall be known among the nations,
10+ I will greatly rejoice in the Lord;
11For as the earth brings forth its sprouts,
