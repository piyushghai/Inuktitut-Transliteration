1+ Then the whole company of them arose and brought him before Pilate. 
2And they began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man + misleading our nation and + forbidding us to give tribute to + Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, + a king.” 
3+ And Pilate asked him, + “Are you the King of the Jews?” And he answered him, + “You have said so.” 
4Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, + “I find no guilt in this man.” 
5But they were urgent, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, + from Galilee even to this place.”
6When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean. 
7And when he learned that he belonged to + Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him over to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time. 
8When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, + for he had long desired to see him, + because he had heard about him, and he was hoping + to see some sign done by him. 
9So he questioned him at some length, but he made no answer. 
10The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him. 
11And Herod with his soldiers + treated him with contempt and + mocked him. Then, + arraying him in splendid clothing, he sent him back to Pilate. 
12And + Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before this they had been at enmity with each other.
13Pilate then called together the chief priests and + the rulers and the people, 
14and said to them, “You brought me this man + as one who was misleading the people. And + after examining him before you, behold, I + did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him. 
15Neither did Herod, for + he sent him back to us. Look, nothing deserving death has been done by him. 
16+ I will therefore punish and release him.”+ 
18+ But they all cried out together, + “Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas”— 
19a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city and + for murder. 
20Pilate addressed them once more, desiring to release Jesus, 
21but they kept shouting, “Crucify, crucify him!” 
22A third time he said to them, “Why, + what evil has he done? + I have found in him no guilt deserving death. + I will therefore punish and release him.” 
23But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he should be crucified. And their voices prevailed. 
24So Pilate decided that their demand should be granted. 
25He released the man who had been thrown into prison + for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, + but he delivered Jesus over to their will.
26+ And as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it behind Jesus. 
27And there followed him a great multitude of the people and of women who were + mourning and lamenting for him. 
28But turning to them Jesus said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
29For behold, + the days are coming when they will say, + ‘Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!’
30+ Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us,’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us.’
31For + if they do these things when + the wood is green, what will happen + when it is dry?”
32+ Two others, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him. 
33+ And when they came to the place that is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, + one on his right and one on his left. 
34And Jesus said, “Father, + forgive them, + for they know not what they do.”+  And they cast lots + to divide his garments. 
35And + the people stood by, watching, + but + the rulers + scoffed at him, saying, + “He saved others; + let him save himself, + if he is + the Christ of God, + his Chosen One!” 
36The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and + offering him sour wine 
37and saying, + “If you are + the King of the Jews, save yourself!” 
38+ There was also an inscription over him,+  “This is + the King of the Jews.”
39+ One of the criminals who were hanged + railed at him,+  saying, “Are you not + the Christ? Save yourself and us!” 
40But the other rebuked him, saying, “Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? 
41And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.” 
42And he said, “Jesus, remember me + when you come into your kingdom.” 
43And he said to him, “Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in + Paradise.”
44+ It was now about the sixth hour,+  and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour,+ 
45while the sun’s light failed. And + the curtain of the temple was torn in two. 
46Then Jesus, + calling out with a loud voice, said, “Father, + into your hands I + commit my spirit!” And having said this + he breathed his last. 
47Now + when the centurion saw what had taken place, + he praised God, saying, “Certainly this man was innocent!” 
48And all the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle, when they saw what had taken place, returned home + beating their breasts. 
49And all + his acquaintances and + the women who had followed him from Galilee + stood at a distance watching these things.
50+ Now there was a man named Joseph, from the Jewish town of Arimathea. He was a member of the council, a good and righteous man, 
51who had not consented to their decision and action; and he + was looking for the kingdom of God. 
52This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 
53Then he took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud and + laid him in a tomb cut in stone, + where no one had ever yet been laid. 
54It was the day of + Preparation, and the Sabbath was beginning.+ 
55+ The women + who had come with him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb and how his body was laid. 
56Then they returned and + prepared spices and ointments.
