1How + lovely is your + dwelling place,
2My soul + longs, yes, + faints
3Even the sparrow finds a home,
4+ Blessed are those who dwell in your house,
5Blessed are those whose strength is in you,
6As they go through the Valley of Baca
7They go + from strength to strength;
8O + Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer;
9+ Behold our + shield, O God;
10For a day + in your courts is better
11For the Lord God is + a sun and + shield;
12O Lord of hosts,
