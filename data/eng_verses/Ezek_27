1The word of the Lord came to me: 
2“Now you, + son of man, + raise a lamentation over Tyre, 
3and say to Tyre, who dwells at + the entrances to the sea, + merchant of the peoples to many coastlands, thus says the Lord God:
4Your borders are + in the heart of the seas;
5They made all your planks
6Of + oaks of Bashan
7+ Of fine embroidered linen from Egypt
8The inhabitants of Sidon and + Arvad
9The elders of + Gebal and her skilled men were in you,
10+ “Persia and + Lud and + Put were in your army as your men of war. + They hung the shield and helmet in you; they gave you splendor. 
11Men of + Arvad and Helech were on your walls all around, and men of Gamad were in your towers. They hung their shields on your walls all around; they made + perfect your beauty.
12+ “Tarshish did + business with you because of your great wealth of every kind; silver, iron, tin, and lead they exchanged for your + wares. 
13+ Javan, + Tubal, and + Meshech traded with you; they exchanged human beings and vessels of bronze for your merchandise. 
14From + Beth-togarmah they exchanged horses, war horses, and mules + for your wares. 
15The men of + Dedan+  traded with you. Many coastlands were your own special markets; they brought you in payment ivory tusks and ebony. 
16Syria + did business with you because of your abundant goods; they exchanged for your wares + emeralds, + purple, + embroidered work, + fine linen, coral, and + ruby. 
17Judah and the land of Israel traded with you; they exchanged for your merchandise + wheat of + Minnith, meal,+  honey, oil, and + balm. 
18+ Damascus did business with you for your abundant goods, because of your great wealth of every kind; wine of Helbon and + wool of Sahar 
19and casks of wine+  from Uzal they exchanged for your wares; wrought iron, + cassia, and + calamus were bartered for your merchandise. 
20Dedan traded with you in saddlecloths for riding. 
21Arabia and all the princes of + Kedar were your favored dealers + in lambs, rams, and goats; in these they did business with you. 
22The traders of + Sheba and + Raamah traded with you; they exchanged + for your wares + the best of all kinds of spices and all precious stones and gold. 
23+ Haran, Canneh, + Eden, traders of Sheba, + Asshur, and Chilmad traded with you. 
24In your market these traded with you in choice garments, in clothes of + blue and + embroidered work, and in carpets of colored material, bound with cords and made secure. 
25+ The ships of + Tarshish traveled for you with your merchandise. So you were filled and heavily laden + in the heart of the seas.
26“Your rowers have brought you out
27Your riches, your wares, your merchandise,
28At the sound of the cry of your pilots
29and down from their ships
30+ and shout aloud over you
31they + make themselves bald for you
32In their wailing they + raise a lamentation for you
33When your wares came from the seas,
34Now + you are wrecked by the seas,
35+ All the inhabitants of the coastlands
36+ The merchants among the peoples + hiss at you;
