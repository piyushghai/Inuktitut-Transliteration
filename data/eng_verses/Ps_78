1+ Give ear, O my people, to my teaching;
2+ I will open my mouth + in a parable;
3things that we have heard and known,
4We will not + hide them from their children,
5He established + a testimony in + Jacob
6that + the next generation might know them,
7so that they should set their hope in God
8and that they should not be + like their fathers,
9The Ephraimites, armed with+  the bow,
10They + did not keep Godâ€™s covenant,
11They + forgot his works
12In the sight of their fathers + he performed wonders
13He + divided the sea and let them pass through it,
14+ In the daytime he led them with a cloud,
15He + split rocks in the wilderness
16He made streams come out of + the rock
17Yet they sinned still more against him,
18They + tested God in their heart
19They spoke against God, saying,
20+ He struck the rock so that water gushed out
21Therefore, when the Lord heard, he was full of wrath;
22because they + did not believe in God
23Yet he commanded the skies above
24and he + rained down on them manna to eat
25Man ate of the bread of + the angels;
26He + caused the east wind to blow in the heavens,
27he rained meat on them like + dust,
28he + let them fall in the midst of their camp,
29And they + ate and were well filled,
30But before they had satisfied their craving,
31the anger of God rose against them,
32In spite of all this, they + still sinned;
33So he made + their days + vanish like+  a breath,+ 
34When he killed them, they + sought him;
35They remembered that God was their + rock,
36But they + flattered him with their mouths;
37Their + heart was not + steadfast toward him;
38Yet he, being + compassionate,
39He + remembered that they were but + flesh,
40How often they + rebelled against him in the wilderness
41They + tested God again and again
42They + did not remember his power+ 
43+ when he performed his + signs in Egypt
44He + turned their rivers to blood,
45He sent among them swarms of + flies, which devoured them,
46He gave their crops to + the destroying locust
47He destroyed their vines with + hail
48He gave over their + cattle to the hail
49He let loose on them his burning anger,
50He made a path for his anger;
51He struck down every + firstborn in Egypt,
52Then he led out his people + like sheep
53+ He led them in safety, so that they + were not afraid,
54And he brought them to his + holy land,
55He + drove out nations before them;
56Yet they + tested and + rebelled against the Most High God
57but turned away and acted treacherously like their fathers;
58For they + provoked him to anger with their + high places;
59When God heard, he was full of + wrath,
60He + forsook his dwelling at + Shiloh,
61and delivered his + power to captivity,
62He + gave his people over to the sword
63+ Fire devoured their young men,
64Their + priests fell by the sword,
65Then the Lord + awoke as from sleep,
66And he + put his adversaries to rout;
67He rejected the tent of + Joseph;
68but he chose the tribe of Judah,
69He + built his sanctuary like the high heavens,
70He + chose David his servant
71from + following the nursing ewes he brought him
72With + upright heart he shepherded them
