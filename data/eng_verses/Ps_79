1O God, + the nations have come into your + inheritance;
2They have given + the bodies of your servants
3They have poured out their blood like water
4We have become + a taunt to our neighbors,
5+ How long, O Lord? Will you be angry + forever?
6+ Pour out your anger on the nations
7For they have devoured Jacob
8+ Do not remember against us + our former iniquities;+ 
9+ Help us, O God of our salvation,
10+ Why should the nations say,
11Let + the groans of the prisoners come before you;
12Return + sevenfold into the + lap of our neighbors
13But we your people, the + sheep of your pasture,
