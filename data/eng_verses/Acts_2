1When + the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all together in one place. 
2And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like + a mighty rushing wind, and + it filled the entire house where they were sitting. 
3And divided tongues + as of fire appeared to them and rested+  on each one of them. 
4And they were all + filled with the Holy Spirit and began + to speak in other tongues + as the Spirit gave them utterance.
5Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven. 
6And + at this sound the multitude came together, and they were bewildered, because each one was hearing them speak in his own language. 
7And + they were amazed and astonished, saying, “Are not all these who are speaking + Galileans? 
8And how is it that we hear, each of us in his own native language? 
9Parthians and + Medes and + Elamites and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, 
10Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, 
11both Jews and + proselytes, Cretans and Arabians—we hear them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God.” 
12And + all were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, “What does this mean?” 
13But others + mocking said, “They are filled with new wine.”
14But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them: “Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words. 
15For these people are not drunk, as you suppose, + since it is only the third hour of the day.+ 
16But this is what was uttered through the prophet Joel:
17+ “‘And in the last days it shall be, God declares,
18even on my male servants+  and female servants
19And I will show wonders in the heavens above
20+ the sun shall be turned to darkness
21And it shall come to pass that + everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.’
22“Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, + a man attested to you by God + with + mighty works and wonders and signs that + God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know— 
23this Jesus,+ + delivered up according to + the definite plan and + foreknowledge of God, + you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. 
24+ God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because + it was not possible for him to be held by it. 
25For David says concerning him,
26therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced;
27For you will not abandon my soul to + Hades,
28You have made known to me the paths of life;
29“Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about + the patriarch David + that he both died and + was buried, and + his tomb is with us to this day. 
30+ Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that + God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, 
31he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that + he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. 
32This Jesus + God raised up, + and of that we all are witnesses. 
33+ Being therefore + exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from + the Father + the promise of the Holy Spirit, + he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing. 
34For + David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says,
35until I make your enemies your footstool.”’
36Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that + God has made him + both Lord and Christ, this Jesus + whom you crucified.”
37Now when + they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, + what shall we do?” 
38And Peter said to them, + “Repent and + be baptized every one of you + in the name of Jesus Christ + for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive + the gift of the Holy Spirit. 
39For + the promise is for you and + for your children and for all + who are far off, everyone + whom the Lord our God calls to himself.” 
40And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, + “Save yourselves from this + crooked generation.” 
41So those who received his word were baptized, and + there were added that day about three thousand souls.
42And + they devoted themselves to the apostles’ + teaching and the + fellowship, to + the breaking of bread and the prayers. 
43And awe+  came upon every soul, and + many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles. 
44And all who believed were together and + had all things in common. 
45And + they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need. 
46And day by day, + attending the temple + together and + breaking bread in their homes, they received their food + with glad and generous hearts, 
47praising God and + having favor with all the people. And the Lord + added to their number + day by day those who + were being saved.
