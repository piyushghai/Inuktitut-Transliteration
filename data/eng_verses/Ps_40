1I + waited patiently for the Lord;
2He drew me up from + the pit of destruction,
3He put + a new song in my mouth,
4Blessed is the man who + makes
5You have multiplied, O Lord my God,
6+ In sacrifice and offering you have not delighted,
7Then I said, â€œBehold, I have come;
8+ I delight to do your will, O my God;
9I have told the glad news of deliverance+ 
10I have not hidden your deliverance within my heart;
11As for you, O Lord, you will not restrain
12For evils have + encompassed me
13+ Be pleased, O Lord, to + deliver me!
14+ Let those be put to shame and disappointed altogether
15Let those be appalled because of their shame
16But may all who seek you
17As for me, I am + poor and needy,
