1“Call now; is there anyone who will answer you?
2Surely vexation kills the fool,
3+ I have seen the fool taking root,
4His children are + far from safety;
5The hungry eat his harvest,
6For affliction does not come from the dust,
7but man is + born to trouble
8“As for me, I would seek God,
9who + does great things and + unsearchable,
10he gives + rain on the earth
11he + sets on high those who are lowly,
12He + frustrates the devices of the crafty,
13He + catches the wise in their own craftiness,
14They meet with darkness in the daytime
15But he + saves the needy from the sword of their mouth
16So the poor have hope,
17“Behold, + blessed is the one whom God reproves;
18For he wounds, but he + binds up;
19He will + deliver you from six troubles;
20+ In famine he will redeem you from death,
21You shall be + hidden from the lash of the tongue,
22At destruction and famine you shall laugh,
23For you shall be in league with the stones of the field,
24You shall know that your + tent is at peace,
25You shall know also that your + offspring shall be many,
26You shall come to your grave in + ripe old age,
27Behold, this we have + searched out; it is true.
