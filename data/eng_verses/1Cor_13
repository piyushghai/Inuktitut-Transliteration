1If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. 
2And if I have + prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, + so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 
3+ If I give away all I have, and + if I deliver up my body to be burned,+  but have not love, I gain nothing.
4+ Love is patient and + kind; love + does not envy or boast; it + is not arrogant 
5or rude. It + does not insist on its own way; it + is not irritable or resentful;+ 
6it + does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but + rejoices with the truth. 
7+ Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, + endures all things.
8Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. 
9For + we know in part and we prophesy in part, 
10but + when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. 
11When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. 
12For + now we see in a mirror dimly, but + then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as + I have been fully known.
13So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.
