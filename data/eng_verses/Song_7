1How beautiful are your feet in sandals,
2Your navel is a rounded bowl
3+ Your two breasts are like two fawns,
4Your + neck is like an ivory tower.
5Your head crowns you like + Carmel,
6+ How beautiful and + pleasant you are,
7Your stature is like a palm tree,
8I say I will climb the palm tree
9and your + mouth+  like the best wine.
10+ I am my belovedâ€™s,
11+ Come, my beloved,
12let us go out early to the vineyards
13+ The mandrakes give forth fragrance,
