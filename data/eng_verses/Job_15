1Then + Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
2“Should + a wise man answer with + windy knowledge,
3Should he argue in unprofitable talk,
4But you are doing away with the fear of God+ 
5For your iniquity teaches your mouth,
6Your + own mouth condemns you, and not I;
7+ “Are you the first man who was born?
8Have you listened in + the council of God?
9+ What do you know that we do not know?
10+ Both the gray-haired and the aged are among us,
11Are the comforts of God too small for you,
12Why does your heart carry you away,
13that you turn your + spirit against God
14+ What is man, + that he can be pure?
15Behold, God+ + puts no trust in his + holy ones,
16+ how much less one who is abominable and + corrupt,
17“I will show you; hear me,
18(what wise men have told,
19to whom alone the land was given,
20The wicked man writhes in pain all his days,
21+ Dreadful sounds are in his ears;
22He does not believe that he will return out of darkness,
23He + wanders abroad for bread, saying, ‘Where is it?’
24distress and anguish terrify him;
25Because he has stretched out his hand against God
26+ running + stubbornly against him
27because he has + covered his face with his fat
28and has lived in desolate cities,
29he will not be rich, and his wealth will not endure,
30he will not depart from darkness;
31Let him not + trust in emptiness, deceiving himself,
32It will be paid in full + before his time,
33He will shake off his unripe grape like the vine,
34For + the company of the godless is barren,
35They + conceive trouble and give birth to evil,
