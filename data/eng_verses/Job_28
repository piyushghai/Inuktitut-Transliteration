1“Surely there is a mine for silver,
2Iron is taken out of the earth,
3Man puts an end to darkness
4He opens shafts in a valley away from where anyone lives;
5As for the earth, + out of it comes bread,
6Its stones are the place of + sapphires,+ 
7“That path no bird of prey knows,
8+ The proud beasts have not trodden it;
9“Man puts his hand to + the flinty rock
10He cuts out channels in the rocks,
11He dams up the streams so that they do not trickle,
12+ “But where shall wisdom be found?
13Man does not know its worth,
14+ The deep says, ‘It is not in me,’
15It + cannot be bought for gold,
16It cannot be valued in + the gold of + Ophir,
17Gold and glass cannot equal it,
18No mention shall be made of + coral or of crystal;
19+ The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it,
20“From where, then, does wisdom come?
21It is hidden from the eyes of + all living
22+ Abaddon and Death say,
23+ “God understands the way to it,
24For he + looks to the ends of the earth
25When he + gave to the wind its weight
26when he made a decree for the rain
27then he saw it and declared it;
28And he said to man,
