1The Lord said to Moses, 
2“See, I have called by name + Bezalel the son of Uri, son of + Hur, of the tribe of Judah, 
3and I have + filled him with the Spirit of God, with ability and intelligence, with knowledge and all craftsmanship, 
4to devise artistic designs, to work in gold, silver, and bronze, 
5in cutting stones for setting, and in carving wood, to work in every craft. 
6And behold, I have appointed with him + Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. And I have given to all able men + ability, that they may make all that I have commanded you: 
7+ the tent of meeting, and + the ark of the testimony, and + the mercy seat that is on it, and all the furnishings of the tent, 
8+ the table and its utensils, and + the pure lampstand with all its utensils, and + the altar of incense, 
9and + the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and + the basin and its stand, 
10and + the finely worked garments,+  the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons, for their service as priests, 
11and + the anointing oil and the fragrant + incense for the Holy Place. According to all that I have commanded you, they shall do.”
12And the Lord said to Moses, 
13“You are to speak to the people of Israel and say, ‘Above all you shall keep my Sabbaths, for this is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I, the Lord, sanctify you. 
14You shall keep the Sabbath, because it is holy for you. Everyone who profanes it shall be put to death. + Whoever does any work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 
15+ Six days shall work be done, but + the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the Lord. + Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall be put to death. 
16Therefore the people of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, observing the Sabbath throughout their generations, as a covenant forever. 
17+ It is a sign forever between me and the people of Israel that + in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and + on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed.’”
18And he gave to Moses, when he had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, the + two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written with + the finger of God.
