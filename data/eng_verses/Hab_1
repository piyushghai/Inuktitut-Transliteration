1+ The oracle that Habakkuk the prophet saw.
2O Lord, + how long shall I cry for help,
3+ Why do you make me see iniquity,
4+ So the law is paralyzed,
5+ â€œLook among the nations, and see;
6For behold, + I am raising up the Chaldeans,
7They are dreaded and fearsome;
8+ Their horses are swifter than leopards,
9They all come + for violence,
10At kings they scoff,
11Then they sweep by like the wind and go on,
12Are you not + from everlasting,
13You who are + of purer eyes than to see evil
14You make mankind like the fish of the sea,
15+ He+  brings all of them up + with a hook;
16+ Therefore he sacrifices to his net
17Is he then to keep on emptying his net
