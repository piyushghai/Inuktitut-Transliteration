1The + oracle concerning + Tyre.
2Be still, O inhabitants of the coast;
3And on many waters
4Be ashamed, O + Sidon, for the sea has spoken,
5When the report comes to Egypt,
6+ Cross over to Tarshish;
7Is this your exultant city
8Who has purposed this
9The Lord of hosts has purposed it,
10Cross over your land like the Nile,
11+ He has stretched out his hand over the sea;
12And he said:
13Behold the land of + the Chaldeans! This is the people that was not;+  Assyria destined it for wild beasts. They erected + their siege towers, they stripped her palaces bare, they made her a ruin.
14+ Wail, O ships of Tarshish,
15In that day Tyre will be forgotten for + seventy years, like the days+  of one king. At the end of + seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the prostitute:
16â€œTake a harp;
17At the end of + seventy years, the Lord will visit Tyre, and she will return to her wages and + will prostitute herself with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth. 
18Her merchandise and her wages will be holy to the Lord. It will not be stored or hoarded, but her merchandise will supply abundant food and fine clothing for those who dwell before the Lord.
