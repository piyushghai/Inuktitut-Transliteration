1Thus says the Lord to + his anointed, to Cyrus,
2“I will go before you
3+ I will give you the treasures of darkness
4For the sake of my servant Jacob,
5+ I am the Lord, and there is no other,
6+ that people may know, from the rising of the sun
7I form light and create darkness,
8+ “Shower, O heavens, from above,
9+ “Woe to him who strives with him who formed him,
10Woe to him who says to a father, ‘What are you begetting?’
11Thus says + the Lord,
12+ I made the earth
13+ I have stirred him up in righteousness,
14Thus says the Lord:
15+ Truly, you are a God who hides himself,
16+ All of them are put to shame and confounded;
17But Israel is saved by the Lord
18+ For thus says the Lord,
19+ I did not speak in secret,
20+ “Assemble yourselves and come;
21+ Declare and present your case;
22“Turn to me and be saved,
23+ By myself I have sworn;
24+ “Only in the Lord, it shall be said of me,
25In the Lord all the offspring of Israel
