1+ In those days Hezekiah became + sick and was at the point of death. And + Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, “Thus says the Lord: Set your house in order, for you shall die, you shall not recover.”+ 
2Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord, 
3and said, “Please, O Lord, remember how + I have walked before you in faithfulness and with a whole heart, and have done what is good in your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
4Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah: 
5“Go and say to Hezekiah, Thus says the Lord, the God of David your father: I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add + fifteen years to your life.+ 
6+ I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and will defend this city.
7“This shall be the sign to you from the Lord, that the Lord will do this thing that he has promised: 
8+ Behold, I will make the shadow cast by the declining sun on the dial of Ahaz turn back ten steps.” So the sun turned back on the dial the ten steps by which it had declined.+ 
9A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, after he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness:
10I said, + In the middle+  of my days
11I said, I shall not see the Lord,
12My dwelling is plucked up and removed from me
13+ I calmed myself+  until morning;
14Like + a swallow or a crane I chirp;
15What shall I say? For he has spoken to me,
16+ O Lord, by these things men live,
17+ Behold, it was for my welfare
18+ For Sheol does not thank you;
19The living, the living, he thanks you,
20The Lord will save me,
21+ Now Isaiah had said, “Let them take a cake of figs and apply it to the boil, that he may recover.” 
22Hezekiah also had said, “What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the Lord?”
