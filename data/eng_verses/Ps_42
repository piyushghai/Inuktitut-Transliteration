1+ As a deer pants for flowing streams,
2+ My soul thirsts for God,
3+ My tears have been my food
4These things I remember,
5+ Why are you cast down, O my soul,
6and my God.
7Deep calls to deep
8By day the Lord+ commands his steadfast love,
9I say to God, + my rock:
10As with a deadly wound in my bones,
11+ Why are you cast down, O my soul,
