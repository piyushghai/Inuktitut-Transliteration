1“Why are + not times of judgment + kept by the Almighty,
2Some move + landmarks;
3They drive away the donkey of the fatherless;
4They + thrust the poor off the road;
5Behold, like wild donkeys in the desert
6They gather their+  fodder in the field,
7They + lie all night naked, without clothing,
8They are wet with the rain of the mountains
9(There are those who snatch the fatherless child from the breast,
10They go about naked, without clothing;
11among the olive rows of the wicked+  they make oil;
12From out of the city the dying groan,
13“There are those who rebel + against the light,
14The murderer rises before it is light,
15The eye of the adulterer also waits for + the twilight,
16In the dark they + dig through houses;
17For + deep darkness is morning to all of them;
18“You say, + ‘Swift are they on the face of the waters;
19Drought and heat snatch away the snow waters;
20The womb forgets them;
21“They wrong the barren, childless woman,
22Yet God+  prolongs the life of the mighty by his power;
23He gives them security, and they are supported,
24They are exalted + a little while, and then + are gone;
25If it is + not so, who will prove me a liar
