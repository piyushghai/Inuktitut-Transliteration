1+ In you, O Lord, do I take refuge;
2In your righteousness deliver me and rescue me;
3Be to me a rock of + refuge,
4+ Rescue me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked,
5For you, O Lord, are my + hope,
6Upon you I have leaned + from before my birth;
7I have been as + a portent to many,
8My + mouth is filled with your praise,
9+ Do not cast me off in the time of old age;
10For my enemies speak concerning me;
11and say, â€œGod has forsaken him;
12O God, be not + far from me;
13May my accusers be + put to shame and consumed;
14But I will + hope continually
15My + mouth will tell of your righteous acts,
16With the mighty deeds of the Lord God I will come;
17O God, from my youth you have taught me,
18So even to + old age and gray hairs,
19Your + righteousness, O God,
20You who have + made me see many troubles and calamities
21You will increase my greatness
22I will also praise you with + the harp
23My lips will shout for joy,
24And my + tongue will talk of your righteous help all the day long,
