1Preserve me, O God, for in you I + take refuge.
2I say to the Lord, â€œYou are my Lord;
3As for + the saints in the land, they are the excellent ones,
4The sorrows of those who run after+  another god shall multiply;
5The Lord is + my chosen portion and my + cup;
6+ The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places;
7I bless the Lord who + gives me counsel;
8+ I have + set the Lord always before me;
9Therefore my heart is glad, and my + whole being+  rejoices;
10For you will not abandon my soul to + Sheol,
11You make known to me + the path of life;
