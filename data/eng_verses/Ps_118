1+ Oh give thanks to the Lord, for he is good;
2+ Let Israel say,
3+ Let the house of Aaron say,
4+ Let those who fear the Lord say,
5+ Out of my distress I + called on the Lord;
6+ The Lord is on my side; + I will not fear.
7+ The Lord is on my side as my helper;
8+ It is better to take refuge in the Lord
9It is better to take refuge in the Lord
10+ All nations surrounded me;
11They surrounded me, surrounded me on every side;
12+ They surrounded me like bees;
13I was + pushed hard,+  so that I was falling,
14The Lord is my strength and my song;
15Glad songs of salvation
16the right hand of the Lord exalts,
17+ I shall not die, but I shall live,
18The Lord has + disciplined me severely,
19+ Open to me the gates of righteousness,
20This is the gate of the Lord;
21I thank you that + you have answered me
22+ The stone that the builders rejected
23This is the Lordâ€™s doing;
24This is the day that the Lord has made;
25Save us, we pray, O Lord!
26+ Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
27The Lord is God,
28You are my God, and I will give thanks to you;
29+ Oh give thanks to the Lord, for he is good;
