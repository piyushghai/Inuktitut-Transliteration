1The word of the Lord came to me: 
2+ “Son of man, say to + the prince of Tyre, Thus says the Lord God:
3+ you are indeed wiser + than + Daniel;
4by your wisdom and your understanding
5by your great wisdom in your trade
6therefore thus says the Lord God:
7therefore, behold, I will bring + foreigners upon you,
8+ They shall thrust you down into the pit,
9+ Will you still say, ‘I am a god,’
10+ You shall die the death of the uncircumcised
11Moreover, the word of the Lord came to me: 
12+ “Son of man, + raise a lamentation over + the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus says the Lord God:
13You were in + Eden, the garden of God;
14You were an anointed + guardian cherub.
15You were blameless in your ways
16In the abundance of + your trade
17+ Your heart was proud because of + your beauty;
18By the multitude of your iniquities,
19All who know you among the peoples
20The word of the Lord came to me: 
21+ “Son of man, + set your face toward + Sidon, and + prophesy against her 
22and say, Thus says the Lord God:
23for I will send + pestilence into her,
24“And for the house of Israel + there shall be no more a brier to prick or + a thorn to hurt them among all their neighbors + who have treated them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the Lord God.
25“Thus says the Lord God: + When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and + manifest my holiness in them in the sight of the nations, + then they shall dwell in their own land that I gave to my servant Jacob. 
26+ And they shall dwell securely in it, and they shall build houses and plant vineyards. They shall dwell securely, + when I execute judgments upon all their neighbors + who have treated them with contempt. + Then they will know that I am the Lord their God.”
