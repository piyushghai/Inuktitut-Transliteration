1It shall come to pass + in the latter days
2and many nations shall come, and say:
3He shall judge between many peoples,
4+ but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree,
5For + all the peoples walk
6+ In that day, declares the Lord,
7and the lame I will make + the remnant,
8And you, O tower of the flock,
9Now why do you cry aloud?
10+ Writhe and groan,+  O daughter of Zion,
11Now + many nations
12But + they do not know
13Arise and thresh,
