1Where has your beloved gone,
2My beloved has gone down to his + garden
3+ I am my beloved’s and my beloved is mine;
4You are beautiful as + Tirzah, + my love,
5Turn away your eyes from me,
6+ Your teeth are like a flock of ewes
7+ Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate
8There are + sixty + queens and eighty + concubines,
9My + dove, my + perfect one, is the only one,
10+ “Who is this who looks down like the dawn,
11I went down to the nut orchard
12+ Before I was aware, my desire set me
13+  Return, return, O + Shulammite,
