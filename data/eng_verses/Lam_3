1+ I am the man who has seen affliction
2he has driven and brought me
3surely against me he turns his hand
4He has made my flesh and my skin waste away;
5+ he has besieged and enveloped me
6+ he has made me dwell in darkness
7+ He has walled me about so that + I cannot escape;
8though + I call and cry for help,
9+ he has blocked my ways with blocks of stones;
10+ He is a bear lying in wait for me,
11+ he turned aside my steps and + tore me to pieces;
12+ he bent his bow + and set me
13He drove into my kidneys
14+ I have become the laughingstock of all peoples,
15+ He has filled me with bitterness;
16+ He has made my teeth grind on gravel,
17my soul is bereft of peace;
18+ so I say, “My endurance has perished;
19+ Remember my affliction and my wanderings,
20My soul continually remembers it
21But this I call to mind,
22+ The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases;+ 
23they are new + every morning;
24+ “The Lord is my portion,” says my soul,
25The Lord is good to those who + wait for him,
26+ It is good that one should wait quietly
27+ It is good for a man that he bear
28Let him + sit alone in silence
29+ let him put his mouth in the dust—
30+ let him give his cheek to the one who strikes,
31+ For the Lord will not
32but, though he + cause grief, + he will have compassion
33+ for he does not afflict from his heart
34To crush underfoot
35+ to deny a man justice
36to subvert a man in his lawsuit,
37+ Who has spoken and it came to pass,
38+ Is it not from the mouth of the Most High
39+ Why should a living man complain,
40Let us test and examine our ways,
41+ Let us lift up our hearts and hands
42+ “We have transgressed and + rebelled,
43“You have wrapped yourself with anger and pursued us,
44+ you have wrapped yourself with a cloud
45+ You have made us scum and garbage
46+ “All our enemies
47+ panic and pitfall have come upon us,
48+ my eyes flow with rivers of tears
49+ “My eyes will flow without ceasing,
50+ until the Lord from heaven
51my eyes cause me grief
52+ “I have been hunted + like a bird
53+ they flung me alive into the pit
54+ water closed over my head;
55+ “I called on your name, O Lord,
56+ you heard my plea, ‘Do not close
57+ You came near when I called on you;
58“You have + taken up my cause, + O Lord;
59You have seen the wrong done to me, + O Lord;
60You have seen all their vengeance,
61+ “You have heard their taunts, O Lord,
62The lips and thoughts + of my assailants
63+ Behold their sitting and their rising;
64+ “You will repay them,+  O Lord,
65You will give them+  dullness of heart;
66You will pursue them+  in anger and + destroy them
