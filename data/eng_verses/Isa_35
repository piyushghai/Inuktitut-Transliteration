1+ The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad;
2it shall blossom abundantly
3+ Strengthen the weak hands,
4Say to those who have an anxious heart,
5+ Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened,
6+ then shall the lame man leap like a deer,
7+ the burning sand shall become a pool,
8+ And a highway shall be there,
9No lion shall be there,
10+ And the ransomed of the Lord shall return
