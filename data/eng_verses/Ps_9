1+  I will give thanks to the Lord with my whole heart;
2I will be glad and + exult in you;
3When my enemies turn back,
4For you have + maintained my just cause;
5You have + rebuked the nations; you have made the wicked perish;
6The enemy came to an end in everlasting ruins;
7But the Lord sits enthroned forever;
8and he + judges the world with righteousness;
9The Lord is + a stronghold for + the oppressed,
10And those who + know your name put their trust in you,
11Sing praises to the Lord, who + sits enthroned in Zion!
12For he who + avenges blood is mindful of them;
13+ Be gracious to me, O Lord!
14that I may recount all your praises,
15The nations have sunk in + the pit that they made;
16The Lord has made himself + known; he has executed judgment;
17The wicked shall + return to Sheol,
18For the needy shall not always be forgotten,
19+ Arise, O Lord! Let not + man prevail;
20Put them in fear, O Lord!
