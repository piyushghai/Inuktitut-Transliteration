1When + Israel went out from Egypt,
2Judah became his + sanctuary,
3+ The sea looked and fled;
4+ The mountains skipped like rams,
5What + ails you, O sea, that you flee?
6O mountains, that you skip like rams?
7+ Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord,
8who turns + the rock into + a pool of water,
