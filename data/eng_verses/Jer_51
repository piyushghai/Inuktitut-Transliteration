1Thus says the Lord:
2and I will send to Babylon winnowers,
3+ Let not the archer bend his bow,
4They shall fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans,
5+ For Israel and Judah have not been forsaken
6+ “Flee from the midst of Babylon;
7Babylon was + a golden cup in the Lord’s hand,
8+ Suddenly Babylon has fallen and been broken;
9We would have healed Babylon,
10+ The Lord has brought about our vindication;
11+ “Sharpen the arrows!
12+ “Set up a standard against the walls of Babylon;
13+ O you who dwell by many waters,
14+ The Lord of hosts has sworn by himself:
15+ “It is he who made the earth by his power,
16When he utters his voice there is a tumult of waters in the heavens,
17Every man is stupid and without knowledge;
18They are worthless, a work of delusion;
19Not like these is he who is the portion of Jacob,
20“You are my hammer and weapon of war:
21with you I break in pieces the horse and his rider;
22with you I break in pieces man and woman;
23with you I break in pieces the shepherd and his flock;
24+ “I will repay Babylon and all the inhabitants of Chaldea before your very eyes for all the evil that they have done in Zion, declares the Lord.
25“Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain,
26No + stone shall be taken from you for a corner
27+ “Set up a standard on the earth;
28+ Prepare + the nations for war against her,
29+ The land trembles and writhes in pain,
30The warriors of Babylon have ceased fighting;
31One + runner runs to meet another,
32the fords have been + seized,
33For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel:
34“Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon + has devoured me;
35The violence done to me and to my kinsmen be upon Babylon,”
36Therefore thus says the Lord:
37and Babylon shall become + a heap of ruins,
38+ “They shall roar together + like lions;
39+ While they are inflamed + I will prepare them a feast
40I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter,
41“How + Babylon+  is taken,
42+ The sea has come up on Babylon;
43Her cities have become a horror,
44And I will punish + Bel in Babylon,
45“Go out of the midst of her, + my people!
46Let not your heart faint, and be not fearful
47“Therefore, behold, the days are coming
48+ Then the heavens and the earth,
49Babylon must fall for the slain of Israel,
50+ “You who have escaped from the sword,
51+ ‘We are put to shame, for we have heard reproach;
52“Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord,
53Though Babylon should + mount up to heaven,
54+ “A voice! A cry from Babylon!
55For the Lord is laying Babylon waste
56for a destroyer has come upon her,
57+ I will make drunk her officials and her wise men,
58“Thus says the Lord of hosts:
59The word that Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah + the son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah king of Judah to Babylon, + in the fourth year of his reign. Seraiah was the quartermaster. 
60+ Jeremiah wrote in a book all the disaster that should come upon Babylon, + all these words that are written concerning Babylon. 
61And Jeremiah said to Seraiah: “When you come to Babylon, see that you read all these words, 
62and say, ‘O Lord, you have said concerning this place that you will cut it off, so + that nothing shall dwell in it, neither man nor beast, and it shall be + desolate forever.’ 
63When you finish reading this book, + + tie a stone to it + and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates, 
64and say, + ‘Thus shall Babylon sink, to rise no more, because of the disaster that I am bringing upon her, + and they shall become exhausted.’”
