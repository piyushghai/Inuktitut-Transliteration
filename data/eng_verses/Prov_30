1The words of Agur son of Jakeh. The oracle.+ 
2Surely I am too + stupid to be a man.
3I have not learned wisdom,
4Who has + ascended to heaven and come down?
5+ Every word of God proves true;
6+ Do not add to his words,
7Two things I ask of you;
8Remove far from me falsehood and lying;
9lest I be + full and + deny you
10+ Do not slander a servant to his master,
11There are those+  who + curse their fathers
12There are those who are + clean in their own eyes
13There are thoseâ€”how + lofty are their eyes,
14There are those whose teeth are + swords,
15The leech has two daughters:
16+ Sheol, + the barren womb,
17The eye that + mocks a father
18+ Three things are + too wonderful for me;
19the way of an eagle in the sky,
20This is the way of an adulteress:
21Under + three things + the earth trembles;
22+ a slave when he becomes king,
23+ an unloved woman when she + gets a husband,
24+ Four things on earth are small,
25+ the ants are a people not strong,
26+ the rock badgers are a people not mighty,
27the locusts have no + king,
28the lizard you can take in your hands,
29+ Three things are stately in their tread;
30the lion, which is mightiest among beasts
31the + strutting rooster,+  the he-goat,
32If you have been foolish, exalting yourself,
33For pressing milk produces curds,
