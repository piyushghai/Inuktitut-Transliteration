1+ Wisdom has built her house;
2She has + slaughtered her beasts; she has + mixed her wine;
3She has + sent out her young women to + call
4+ “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!”
5“Come, + eat of my bread
6Leave + your simple ways,+  and + live,
7Whoever corrects a scoffer gets himself abuse,
8+ Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you;
9Give instruction+  to a wise man, and he will be + still wiser;
10+ The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,
11For by me + your days will be multiplied,
12+ If you are wise, you are wise for yourself;
13+ The woman Folly is + loud;
14She sits at the door of her house;
15calling to those who pass by,
16+ “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!”
17+ “Stolen water is sweet,
18But he does not know + that the dead+  are there,
