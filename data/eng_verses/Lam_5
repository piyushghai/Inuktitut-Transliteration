1+ Remember, O Lord, what has befallen us;
2+ Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers,
3We have become orphans, fatherless;
4We must pay for the water we drink;
5+ Our pursuers are at our necks;+ 
6We have given the hand to + Egypt, and to + Assyria,
7Our fathers sinned, and are no more;
8+ Slaves rule over us;
9+ We get our bread at the peril of our lives,
10+ Our skin is hot as an oven
11Women are raped in Zion,
12+ Princes are hung up by their hands;
13Young men are compelled to + grind at the mill,
14+ The old men have left the city gate,
15+ The joy of our hearts has ceased;
16+ The crown has fallen from our head;
17For this + our heart has become sick,
18for Mount Zion which lies desolate;
19+ But you, O Lord, reign forever;
20+ Why do you forget us forever,
21+ Restore us to yourself, O Lord, that we may be restored!
22+ unless you have utterly rejected us,
