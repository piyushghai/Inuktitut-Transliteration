1+ Return, O Israel, to the Lord your God,
2Take with you words
3+ Assyria shall not save us;
4I + will heal their apostasy;
5+ I will be like the dew to Israel;
6his shoots shall spread out;
7They shall return and + dwell beneath my+  shadow;
8O + Ephraim, what have I to do with idols?
9+ Whoever is wise, let him understand these things;
