1+ The scatterer has come up against you.
2For + the Lord is restoring the majesty of Jacob
3The shield of his mighty men is red;
4+ The chariots race madly through the streets;
5He remembers + his officers;
6+ The river gates are opened;
7its mistress+  is + stripped;+  she is carried off,
8+ Nineveh is like a pool
9Plunder the silver,
10+ Desolate! Desolation and ruin!
11Where is the lionsâ€™ den,
12+ The lion tore enough for his cubs
13+ Behold, I am against you, declares the Lord of hosts, and + I will burn your+  chariots in smoke, and the sword shall devour your young lions. I will cut off your prey from the earth, and + the voice of your messengers shall no longer be heard.
