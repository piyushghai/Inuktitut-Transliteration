1Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and + all the host of them. 
2And + on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done. 
3So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation.
4+ These are the generations
5When no + bush of the field+  was yet in the land+  and no small plant of the field had yet sprung up—for the Lord God had not caused it to rain on the land, and there was no man + to work the ground, 
6and a mist+  was going up from the land and was watering the whole face of the ground— 
7then the Lord God formed the man of + dust from the ground and + breathed into his + nostrils the breath of life, and + the man became a living creature. 
8And the Lord God planted a + garden in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed. 
9And out of the ground the Lord God made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. + The tree of life was in the midst of the garden, + and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
10A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and became four rivers. 
11The name of the first is the Pishon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of + Havilah, where there is gold. 
12And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there. 
13The name of the second river is the Gihon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Cush. 
14And the name of the third river is the + Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
15The Lord God took the man + and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it. 
16And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, “You may surely eat of every tree of the garden, 
17but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil + you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat+  of it you + shall surely die.”
18Then the Lord God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; + I will make him a helper fit for+  him.” 
19+ Now out of the ground the Lord God had formed+  every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and + brought them to the man to see what he would call them. And whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name. 
20The man gave names to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field. But for Adam+  there was not found a helper fit for him. 
21So the Lord God caused a + deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. 
22And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man he made+  into a woman and brought her to the man. 
23Then the man said,
24+ Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. 
25And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.
