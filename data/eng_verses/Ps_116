1I + love the Lord, because he has + heard
2Because he + inclined his ear to me,
3+ The snares of death encompassed me;
4Then + I called on the name of the Lord:
5+ Gracious is the Lord, and + righteous;
6The Lord preserves + the simple;
7Return, O my soul, to your + rest;
8For + you have delivered my soul from death,
9I will walk before the Lord
10+ I believed, + even when+  I spoke:
11+ I said in my alarm,
12What shall I + render to the Lord
13I will lift up + the cup of salvation
14I will + pay my vows to the Lord
15+ Precious in the sight of the Lord
16O Lord, I am your + servant;
17I will + offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving
18I will + pay my vows to the Lord
19in + the courts of the house of the Lord,
