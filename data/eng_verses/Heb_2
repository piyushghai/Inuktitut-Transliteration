1Therefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it. 
2For since + the message declared by angels proved to be reliable, and + every transgression or disobedience received a just + retribution, 
3+ how shall we escape if we + neglect such a great salvation? It was + declared at first by the Lord, and it was + attested to us + by those who heard, 
4+ while God also bore witness + by signs and wonders and various miracles and by + gifts of the Holy Spirit + distributed according to his will.
5For it was not to angels that God subjected the world + to come, of which we are speaking. 
6It has been testified somewhere,
7You made him for a little while lower than the angels;
8putting everything in subjection under his feet.‚Äù
9But we see him + who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus, + crowned with glory and honor + because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might + taste death + for everyone.
10For it + was fitting that he, + for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons + to glory, should make the + founder of their salvation + perfect through suffering. 
11For + he who sanctifies and + those who are sanctified + all have one source.+  That is why he is not ashamed to call them + brothers,+ 
12saying,
13And again,
14Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise + partook of the same things, that + through death he might + destroy + the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, 
15and deliver all those who + through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery. 
16For surely it is not angels that he helps, but he + helps the offspring of Abraham. 
17Therefore he had + to be made like his brothers in every respect, + so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest + in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. 
18For because he himself has suffered + when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.
