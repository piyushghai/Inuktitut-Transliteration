1+ Be gracious to me, O God, for man + tramples on me;
2my enemies trample on me all day long,
3When I am afraid,
4In God, whose word I praise,
5All day long they injure my cause;+ 
6They + stir up strife, they + lurk;
7For their crime will they escape?
8You have kept count of my tossings;+ 
9Then my enemies will turn back
10In God, whose word I praise,
11in God I trust; + I shall not be afraid.
12I must perform my + vows to you, O God;
13+ For you have delivered my soul from death,
