1A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to Shigionoth.
2O Lord, + I have heard the report of you,
3God came from + Teman,
4+ His brightness was like the light;
5+ Before him went pestilence,
6He stood + and measured the earth;
7I saw the tents of + Cushan in affliction;
8+ Was your wrath against the rivers, O Lord?
9You stripped the sheath from your bow,
10+ The mountains saw you and writhed;
11+ The sun and moon stood still in their place
12+ You marched through the earth in fury;
13+ You went out for the salvation of your people,
14You pierced with his own arrows the heads of his warriors,
15+ You trampled the sea with your horses,
16+ I hear, and + my body trembles;
17Though the fig tree should not blossom,
18+ yet I will rejoice in the Lord;
19God, the Lord, is my strength;
