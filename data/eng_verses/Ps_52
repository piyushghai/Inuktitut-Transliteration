1Why do you boast of evil, O mighty man?
2Your + tongue plots destruction,
3You love evil more than good,
4You love all words that devour,
5But God will break you down forever;
6The righteous shall + see and fear,
7â€œSee the man who would not make
8But I am like + a green olive tree
9I will thank you forever,
