1+ Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day:
2“That the leaders took the lead in Israel,
3“Hear, O kings; give ear, O princes;
4“Lord, + when you went out from Seir,
5The mountains + quaked before the Lord,
6“In the days of + Shamgar, son of Anath,
7The villagers ceased in Israel;
8+ When new gods were chosen,
9My heart goes out to the commanders of Israel
10“Tell of it, + you who ride on white donkeys,
11To the sound of musicians+  at the watering places,
12+ “Awake, awake, Deborah!
13Then down marched the remnant of the noble;
14From + Ephraim their root + they marched down into the valley,+ 
15the princes of Issachar came with Deborah,
16Why did you sit still + among the sheepfolds,
17+ Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan;
18+ Zebulun is a people who risked their lives to the death;
19“The kings came, they fought;
20+ From heaven the stars fought,
21+ The torrent Kishon swept them away,
22“Then loud beat the horses’ hoofs
23“Curse Meroz, says the angel of the Lord,
24“Most blessed of women be + Jael,
25+ He asked for water and she gave him milk;
26+ She sent her hand to the tent peg
27Between her feet
28+ “Out of the window she peered,
29Her wisest princesses answer,
30‘Have they not found and + divided the spoil?—
31+ “So may all your enemies perish, O Lord!
