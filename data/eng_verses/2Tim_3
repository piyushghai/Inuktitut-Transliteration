1But understand this, that + in the last days there will come times of difficulty. 
2For people will be + lovers of self, + lovers of money, + proud, + arrogant, abusive, + disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, 
3+ heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, + not loving good, 
4treacherous, reckless, + swollen with conceit, + lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, 
5having the appearance of godliness, but + denying its power. + Avoid such people. 
6For among them are + those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions, 
7always learning and never able to + arrive at a knowledge of the truth. 
8Just as + Jannes and Jambres + opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, + men corrupted in mind and + disqualified regarding the faith. 
9But they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all, + as was that of those two men.
10+ You, however, have followed my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life, my faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness, 
11my persecutions and sufferings that happened to me + at Antioch, + at Iconium, and + at Lystraâ€”which persecutions I endured; yet + from them all + the Lord rescued me. 
12Indeed, all who desire to + live a godly life in Christ Jesus + will be persecuted, 
13while + evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and + being deceived. 
14But as for you, + continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom+  you learned it 
15and how + from childhood you have been acquainted with + the sacred writings, + which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 
16+ All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, 
17that + the man of God+  may be complete, + equipped + for every good work.
