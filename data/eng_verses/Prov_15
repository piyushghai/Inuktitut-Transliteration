1+ A soft answer turns away wrath,
2The tongue of the wise commends knowledge,
3+ The eyes of the Lord are in every place,
4+ A gentle+  tongue is + a tree of life,
5+ A fool + despises his fatherâ€™s instruction,
6In the house of the righteous there is much treasure,
7+ The lips of the wise spread knowledge;
8+ The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord,
9The way of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord,
10There is + severe discipline for him who forsakes the way;
11Sheol and Abaddon lie open before the Lord;
12+ A scoffer + does not like to be reproved;
13+ A glad heart makes a cheerful face,
14+ The heart of him who has understanding seeks knowledge,
15All the days of the afflicted are evil,
16+ Better is a little with the fear of the Lord
17+ Better is a dinner of herbs where love is
18+ A hot-tempered man + stirs up strife,
19The way of + a sluggard is like a hedge of + thorns,
20+ A wise son makes a glad father,
21+ Folly is a joy to him who lacks sense,
22+ Without counsel plans fail,
23To make an apt answer is a joy to a man,
24The path of life leads upward + for the prudent,
25The Lord tears down the house of + the proud
26+ The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the Lord,
27Whoever is + greedy for unjust gain + troubles his own household,
28The heart of the righteous + ponders how to answer,
29The Lord is + far from the wicked,
30+ The light of the eyes rejoices the heart,
31+ The ear that listens to + life-giving reproof
32Whoever + ignores instruction + despises himself,
33+ The fear of the Lord is instruction in wisdom,
