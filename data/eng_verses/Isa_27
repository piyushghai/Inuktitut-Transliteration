1In that day the Lord with his hard and great and strong + sword will punish + Leviathan the fleeing serpent, + Leviathan the twisting serpent, and he will slay + the dragon that is in the sea.
2In that day,
3I, the Lord, am its keeper;
4I have no wrath.
5Or let them lay hold of my protection,
6+ In days to come+  Jacob shall take root,
7+ Has he struck them + as he struck those who struck them?
8+ Measure by measure,+  by exile you contended with them;
9Therefore by this + the guilt of Jacob will be atoned for,
10+ For the fortified city is solitary,
11When its boughs are dry, they are broken;
12In that day + from the river Euphrates+  to the Brook of Egypt the Lord will thresh out the grain, and you will be gleaned one by one, O people of Israel. 
13And in that day + a great trumpet will be blown, + and those who were lost in the land of Assyria and those who were driven out to the land of Egypt + will come and worship the Lord on the holy mountain at Jerusalem.
