1The word of the Lord that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel:
2+ Hear this, + you elders;
3+ Tell your children of it,
4What + the cutting locust left,
5Awake, you drunkards, and weep,
6For + a nation has come up against my land,
7It has laid waste my vine
8Lament like a virgin+ + wearing sackcloth
9+ The grain offering and the drink offering are cut off
10The fields are destroyed,
11+ Be ashamed,+  O tillers of the soil;
12The vine dries up;
13+ Put on sackcloth and lament, + O priests;
14+ Consecrate a fast;
15Alas for the day!
16Is not the food cut off
17+ The seed shrivels under the clods;+ 
18How + the beasts groan!
19To you, + O Lord, I call.
20Even the beasts of the field + pant for you
