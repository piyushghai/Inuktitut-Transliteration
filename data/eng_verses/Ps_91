1He who dwells in + the shelter of the Most High
2I will say+  to the Lord, “My + refuge and my + fortress,
3For he will deliver you from + the snare of the fowler
4He will + cover you with his pinions,
5+ You will not fear + the terror of the night,
6nor the pestilence that stalks in darkness,
7A thousand may fall at your side,
8You will only look with your eyes
9Because you have made the Lord your + dwelling place—
10+ no evil shall be allowed to befall you,
11+ For he will command his + angels concerning you
12On their hands they will bear you up,
13You will tread on + the lion and the + adder;
14“Because he + holds fast to me in love, I will deliver him;
15When he + calls to me, I will answer him;
16With + long life I will satisfy him
