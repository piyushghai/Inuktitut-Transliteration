1+  Now muster your troops, O daughter+  of troops;
2+ + But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah,
3Therefore he shall give them up + until the time
4And he shall stand + and shepherd his flock + in the strength of the Lord,
5And he shall be + their peace.
6they shall shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword,
7Then + the remnant of Jacob shall be
8And + the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations,
9Your hand shall + be lifted up over your adversaries,
10And + in that day, declares the Lord,
11+ and I will cut off the cities of your land
12and I will cut off + sorceries from your hand,
13and + I will cut off your carved images
14and I will root out your + Asherah images from among you
15And in anger and wrath + I will execute vengeance
