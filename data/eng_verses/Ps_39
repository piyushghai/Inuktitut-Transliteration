1I said, “I will + guard my ways,
2I was + mute and silent;
3My + heart became hot within me.
4“O Lord, + make me know my end
5Behold, you have made my days a few handbreadths,
6Surely a man + goes about as a shadow!
7“And now, O Lord, for what do I wait?
8Deliver me from all my transgressions.
9+ I am mute; I do not open my mouth,
10+ Remove your stroke from me;
11When you discipline a man
12+ “Hear my prayer, O Lord,
13+ Look away from me, that I may smile again,
