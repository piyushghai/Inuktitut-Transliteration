1â€œCome, let us + return to the Lord;
2After two days + he will revive us;
3+ Let us know; + let us press on to know the Lord;
4What shall I do with you, + O + Ephraim?
5Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets;
6For + I desire steadfast love+  and not sacrifice,
7But + like Adam they + transgressed the covenant;
8+ Gilead is a city of evildoers,
9As robbers + lie in wait for a man,
10In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing;
11For you also, O + Judah, + a harvest is appointed,
