1The + oracle concerning the wilderness of + the sea.
2A stern vision is told to me;
3Therefore my loins are filled with anguish;
4My heart staggers; horror has appalled me;
5+ They prepare the table,
6For thus the Lord said to me:
7When he sees riders, horsemen in pairs,
8Then he who saw cried out:+ 
9And behold, here come riders,
10O + my threshed and winnowed one,
11The + oracle concerning + Dumah.
12The watchman says:
13The + oracle concerning + Arabia.
14To the thirsty bring water;
15For they have fled from the swords,
16For thus the Lord said to me, “Within a year, + according to the years of a hired worker, all the glory of + Kedar will come to an end. 
17And the remainder of the archers of the mighty men of the sons of + Kedar will be few, + for the Lord, the God of Israel, has spoken.”
