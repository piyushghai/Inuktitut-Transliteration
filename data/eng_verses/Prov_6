1My son, if you have put up + security for your neighbor,
2if you are + snared in the words of your mouth,
3then do this, my son, and save yourself,
4+ Give your eyes no sleep
5save yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,+ 
6+ Go to + the ant, O + sluggard;
7+ Without having any chief,
8she prepares her bread + in summer
9+ How long will you lie there, + O sluggard?
10+ A little sleep, a little slumber,
11+ and poverty will come upon you like a robber,
12+ A worthless person, a wicked man,
13+ winks with his eyes, signals+  with his feet,
14with + perverted heart + devises evil,
15therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly;
16There are + six things that the Lord hates,
17+ haughty eyes, + a lying tongue,
18+ a heart that devises wicked plans,
19+ a false witness who + breathes out lies,
20+ My son, keep your father’s commandment,
21+ Bind them on your heart always;
22+ When you walk, they+  will lead you;
23For the commandment is + a lamp and the teaching a light,
24to preserve you from the evil woman,+ 
25+ Do not desire her beauty in your heart,
26for + the price of a prostitute is only + a loaf of bread,+ 
27Can a man carry + fire next to his + chest
28Or can one + walk on hot coals
29So is he who goes in to his neighbor’s wife;
30People do not despise a thief if he steals
31but + if he is caught, he will pay + sevenfold;
32He who commits adultery lacks sense;
33He will get wounds and dishonor,
34For + jealousy makes a man furious,
35He will accept no compensation;
