1The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord: 
2“Arise, and go down to + the potter’s house, and there I will let you hear my words.” 
3So I went down to + the potter’s house, and there he was working at his wheel. 
4And the vessel he was making of clay was + spoiled in the potter’s hand, and + he reworked it into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to do.
5Then the word of the Lord came to me: 
6“O house of Israel, + can I not do with you as this potter has done? declares the Lord. + Behold, like the clay in the potter’s hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel. 
7If at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom, that I will + pluck up and break down and destroy it, 
8and if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, + turns from its evil, + I will relent of the disaster that I intended to do to it. 
9And if at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will + build and plant it, 
10and if it does evil in my sight, not listening to my voice, then I will relent of the good that I had intended to do to it. 
11Now, therefore, say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: ‘Thus says the Lord, Behold, I am shaping disaster against you and devising a plan against you. + Return, every one from his evil way, and + amend your ways and your deeds.’
12“But they say, + ‘That is in vain! We will follow our own plans, and will every one act according to + the stubbornness of his evil heart.’
13“Therefore thus says the Lord:
14Does the snow of Lebanon leave
15+ But my people have forgotten me;
16making their land + a horror,
17+ Like the east wind + I will scatter them
18Then they said, + “Come, let us make plots against Jeremiah, + for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. + Come, let us strike him with the tongue, and let us not pay attention to any of his words.”
19Hear me, O Lord,
20+ Should good be repaid with evil?
21Therefore + deliver up their children to famine;
22+ May a cry be heard from their houses,
23Yet + you, O Lord, know
