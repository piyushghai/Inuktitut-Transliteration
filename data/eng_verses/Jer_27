1In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah+  the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord. 
2Thus the Lord said to me: + “Make yourself straps and + yoke-bars, and put them on your neck. 
3Send word+  to the king of + Edom, the king of + Moab, the king of the sons of + Ammon, the king of + Tyre, and the king of Sidon by the hand of the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah. 
4Give them this charge for their masters: ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: This is what you shall say to your masters: 
5“It is I who + by my great power and my outstretched arm + have made the earth, with the men and animals that are on the earth, + and I give it to whomever it seems right to me. 
6+ Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, + my servant, + and I have given him also the beasts of the field to serve him. 
7+ All the nations shall serve him and + his son and + his grandson, + until the time of his own land comes. + Then many nations and great kings shall make him their slave.
8“‘“But if any nation or kingdom will not serve this Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, + and put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will punish that nation + with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, declares the Lord, until I have consumed it by his hand. 
9So + do not listen to your + prophets, your diviners, your dreamers, your + fortune-tellers, or your sorcerers, who are saying to you, ‘You shall not serve the king of Babylon.’ 
10+ For it is a lie that they are prophesying to you, with the result that you will be removed far from your land, and I will drive you out, and you will perish. 
11+ But any nation that will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will leave on its own land, to work it and dwell there, declares the Lord.”’”
12To + Zedekiah king of Judah I spoke in like manner: + “Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and + serve him and his people and live. 
13+ Why will you and your people die + by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, + as the Lord has spoken concerning any nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? 
14+ Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are saying to you, ‘You shall not serve the king of Babylon,’ + for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you. 
15I have not sent them, declares the Lord, but + they are prophesying falsely in my name, with the result that I will drive you out and you will perish, you and the prophets who are prophesying to you.”
16Then I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, “Thus says the Lord: + Do not listen to the words of your prophets who are prophesying to you, saying, + ‘Behold, the vessels of the Lord’s house will now shortly be brought back from Babylon,’ + for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you. 
17+ Do not listen to them; + serve the king of Babylon and live. Why should this city + become a desolation? 
18If they are prophets, and if the word of the Lord is with them, then + let them intercede with the Lord of hosts, + that the vessels that are left in the house of the Lord, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem may not go to Babylon. 
19+ For thus says the Lord of hosts concerning the pillars, the sea, the stands, and the rest of the vessels that are left in this city, 
20which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take away, + when he took into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem— 
21thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, + concerning the vessels that are left in the house of the Lord, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem: 
22+ They shall be carried to Babylon + and remain there + until the day when I visit them, declares the Lord. + Then I will bring them back + and restore them to this place.”
