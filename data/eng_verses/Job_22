1Then + Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
2+ “Can a man be profitable to God?
3Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are in the right,
4Is it for your fear of him that he reproves you
5Is not your evil abundant?
6For you have + exacted pledges of your brothers for nothing
7You have given no water to the weary to drink,
8+ The man with power possessed the land,
9You have + sent widows away empty,
10Therefore + snares are all around you,
11or + darkness, so that you cannot see,
12“Is not God high in the heavens?
13But you say, + ‘What does God know?
14+ Thick clouds veil him, so that he does not see,
15Will you keep to the old way
16They were snatched away + before their time;
17They said to God, + ‘Depart from us,’
18Yet he filled their houses with good things—
19+ The righteous see it and are glad;
20saying, ‘Surely our adversaries are cut off,
21+ “Agree with God, and + be at peace;
22Receive instruction from + his mouth,
23If you + return to the Almighty you will be + built up;
24if you lay gold in + the dust,
25then the Almighty will be your gold
26For then you + will delight yourself in the Almighty
27You will + make your prayer to him, and he will hear you,
28You will decide on a matter, and it will be established for you,
29For when they are humbled you say, ‘It is because of pride’;+ 
30He + delivers even the one who is not innocent,
