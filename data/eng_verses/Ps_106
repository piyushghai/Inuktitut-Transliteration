1+ Praise the Lord!
2Who can utter the mighty deeds of the Lord,
3Blessed are they who observe justice,
4+ Remember me, O Lord, when you show favor to your people;
5that I may look upon the prosperity of your + chosen ones,
6+ Both we and + our fathers have sinned;
7Our fathers, when they were in Egypt,
8Yet he saved them + for his name’s sake,
9He + rebuked the Red Sea, and it + became dry,
10So he + saved them from the hand of the foe
11And + the waters covered their adversaries;
12Then + they believed his words;
13But they soon + forgot his works;
14But they had + a wanton craving in the wilderness,
15he + gave them what they asked,
16When men in the camp + were jealous of Moses
17+ the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,
18+ Fire also broke out in their company;
19They + made a calf in Horeb
20They + exchanged the glory of God+ 
21They + forgot God, their Savior,
22wondrous works in + the land of Ham,
23Therefore + he said he would destroy them—
24Then they + despised + the pleasant land,
25They + murmured in their tents,
26Therefore he + raised his hand and swore to them
27and would make their offspring fall among the nations,
28Then they + yoked themselves to the + Baal of Peor,
29they provoked the Lord to anger with their deeds,
30Then + Phinehas stood up and intervened,
31And that was + counted to him as righteousness
32They + angered him at the waters of Meribah,
33for they + made his spirit bitter,+ 
34They did not + destroy the peoples,
35but they + mixed with the nations
36They served their idols,
37They + sacrificed their sons
38they poured out innocent blood,
39Thus they + became unclean by their acts,
40Then + the anger of the Lord was kindled against + his people,
41he + gave them into the hand of the nations,
42Their enemies + oppressed them,
43+ Many times he delivered them,
44Nevertheless, he looked upon their distress,
45For their sake he + remembered his covenant,
46He caused them to be + pitied
47+ Save us, O Lord our God,
48+ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,
