1+ Listen to me in silence, + O coastlands;
2+ Who stirred up one from the east
3He pursues them and passes on safely,
4+ Who has performed and done this,
5+ The coastlands have seen and are afraid;
6Everyone helps his neighbor
7+ The craftsman strengthens the goldsmith,
8But you, Israel, + my servant,
9you whom I took from the ends of the earth,
10fear not, for I am with you;
11+ Behold, all who are incensed against you
12+ You shall seek those who contend with you,
13For I, the Lord your God,
14Fear not, you + worm Jacob,
15+ Behold, I make of you a threshing sledge,
16+ you shall winnow them, and + the wind shall carry them away,
17+ When the poor and needy seek water,
18+ I will open rivers on the bare heights,
19+ I will put in the wilderness the cedar,
20that they may see and know,
21Set forth your case, says the Lord;
22Let them bring them, and + tell us
23+ Tell us what is to come hereafter,
24Behold, + you are nothing,
25+ I stirred up one from the north, and he has come,
26+ Who declared it from the beginning, that we might know,
27+ I was the first to say+  to Zion, “Behold, here they are!”
28+ But when I look, there is no one;
29+ Behold, they are all a delusion;
