1I will + extol you, O Lord, for you have drawn me up
2O Lord my God, I + cried to you for help,
3O Lord, you have brought up my soul from + Sheol;
4Sing praises to the Lord, O you + his saints,
5+ For his anger is but for a moment,
6As for me, I said in my + prosperity,
7By your favor, O Lord,
8To you, O Lord, I cry,
9â€œWhat profit is there in my death,+ 
10+ Hear, O Lord, and be merciful to me!
11You have turned for me my mourning into + dancing;
12that my + glory may sing your praise and not be silent.
