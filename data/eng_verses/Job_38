1Then the Lord+ answered Job out of the whirlwind and said:
2“Who is this that + darkens counsel by words + without knowledge?
3+ Dress for action+  like a man;
4“Where were you when I + laid the foundation of the earth?
5Who determined its measurements—surely you know!
6On what were its bases sunk,
7when the morning stars + sang together
8“Or who + shut in the sea with doors
9when I made clouds its garment
10and prescribed + limits for it
11and said, ‘Thus far shall you come, and no farther,
12“Have you + commanded the morning since your days began,
13that it might take hold of + the skirts of the earth,
14It is changed like clay under the seal,
15From the wicked their + light is withheld,
16“Have you + entered into the springs of the sea,
17Have + the gates of death been revealed to you,
18Have you comprehended the expanse of the earth?
19“Where is the way to the dwelling of light,
20that you may take it to its territory
21You know, for + you were born then,
22“Have you entered + the storehouses of the snow,
23which I have reserved + for the time of trouble,
24What is the way to the place where the light is distributed,
25“Who has cleft a channel for the torrents of rain
26to bring rain on + a land where no man is,
27to satisfy the waste and desolate land,
28“Has + the rain a father,
29From whose womb did + the ice come forth,
30The waters become hard like stone,
31“Can you bind the chains of + the Pleiades
32Can you lead forth the Mazzaroth+  in their season,
33Do you know + the ordinances of the heavens?
34“Can you lift up your voice to the clouds,
35Can you send forth lightnings, that they may go
36Who has + put wisdom in + the inward parts+ 
37Who can number the clouds by wisdom?
38when the dust runs into a mass
39“Can you hunt the prey for the lion,
40when they crouch in their + dens
41Who provides for + the raven its prey,
