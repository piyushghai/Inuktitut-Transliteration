1Set + the trumpet to your lips!
2To me they cry,
3Israel has spurned the good;
4+ They made kings, + but not through me.
5+ I have+  spurned your calf, O Samaria.
6For it is from Israel;
7For + they sow the wind,
8+ Israel is swallowed up;
9For + they have gone up to Assyria,
10Though they hire allies among the nations,
11Because Ephraim + has multiplied altars for sinning,
12+ Were I to write for him my laws by the ten thousands,
13As for my sacrificial offerings,
14For + Israel has forgotten + his Maker
