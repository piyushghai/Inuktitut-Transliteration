1+ For Zionâ€™s sake I will not keep silent,
2+ The nations shall see your righteousness,
3You shall be + a crown of beauty in the hand of the Lord,
4+ You shall no more be termed + Forsaken,+ 
5For as a young man marries a young woman,
6On your walls, O Jerusalem,
7and give him no rest
8The Lord has sworn + by his right hand
9but + those who garner it shall eat it
10Go through, go through the gates;
11Behold, the Lord has proclaimed
12+ And they shall be called The Holy People,
