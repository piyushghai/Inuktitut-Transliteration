1Whoever + isolates himself seeks his own desire;
2A fool takes no pleasure in understanding,
3When wickedness comes, contempt comes also,
4The words of a man’s mouth are + deep waters;
5It is not good to + be partial to+  the wicked
6A fool’s lips walk into a fight,
7+ A fool’s mouth is his ruin,
8+ The words of a whisperer are like delicious morsels;
9Whoever is slack in his work
10+ The name of the Lord is + a strong tower;
11+ A rich man’s wealth is his strong city,
12+ Before destruction a man’s heart is haughty,
13If one gives an answer + before he hears,
14A man’s spirit will endure sickness,
15An intelligent heart acquires knowledge,
16A man’s + gift makes room for him
17The one who states his case first seems right,
18+ The lot puts an end to quarrels
19A brother offended is more unyielding than a strong city,
20+ From the fruit of a man’s mouth his stomach is satisfied;
21+ Death and life are in the power of the tongue,
22He who finds + a wife finds + a good thing
23The poor use entreaties,
24A man of many companions may come to ruin,
