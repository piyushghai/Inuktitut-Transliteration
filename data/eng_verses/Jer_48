1+ Concerning Moab.
2the renown of Moab is no more.
3“A voice! A cry from + Horonaim,
4Moab is destroyed;
5+ For at the ascent of Luhith
6Flee! Save yourselves!
7For, + because you trusted in your works and your treasures,
8+ The destroyer shall come upon every city,
9“Give wings to Moab,
10+ “Cursed is he who does + the work of the Lord with slackness, and cursed is he who keeps back his sword from bloodshed.
11“Moab has been at ease from his youth
12“Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I shall send to him pourers who will pour him, and empty his vessels and break his+  jars in pieces. 
13Then + Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as + the house of Israel was ashamed of + Bethel, their confidence.
14“How do you say, ‘We are heroes
15The destroyer of + Moab and his cities has come up,
16The calamity of Moab is near at hand,
17+ Grieve for him, all you who are around him,
18+ “Come down from your glory,
19+ Stand by the way + and watch,
20Moab is put to shame, for it is broken;
21“Judgment has come upon + the tableland, upon Holon, and + Jahzah, and Mephaath, 
22and + Dibon, and + Nebo, and Beth-diblathaim, 
23and + Kiriathaim, and Beth-gamul, and + Beth-meon, 
24and + Kerioth, and + Bozrah, and all the cities of the land of Moab, far and near. 
25+ The horn of Moab is cut off, and + his arm is broken, declares the Lord.
26+ “Make him drunk, + because he magnified himself against the Lord, so that Moab shall + wallow in his vomit, + and he too shall be held in derision. 
27+ Was not Israel a derision to you? + Was he found among thieves, that whenever you spoke of him + you wagged your head?
28+ “Leave the cities, and dwell in the rock,
29+ We have heard of the pride of Moab—
30I know his insolence, declares the Lord;
31+ Therefore I wail for Moab;
32More than for + Jazer I weep for you,
33+ Gladness and joy have been taken away
34+ “From the outcry at Heshbon even to Elealeh, as far as Jahaz they utter their voice, from Zoar to + Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyah. For the waters of Nimrim also have become desolate. 
35And I will bring to an end in Moab, declares the Lord, him who offers sacrifice in + the high place and makes offerings to his god. 
36Therefore my heart moans for Moab like a flute, and my heart moans like a flute for the men of + Kir-hareseth. + Therefore the riches they gained have perished.
37+ “For every head is shaved and every beard cut off. + On all the hands are gashes, and + around the waist is sackcloth. 
38On all the housetops of Moab and in the squares there is nothing but lamentation, for I have broken Moab like + a vessel for which no one cares, declares the Lord. 
39How it is broken! How they wail! + How Moab has turned his back in shame! So Moab + has become a derision and a horror to all that are around him.”
40For thus says the Lord:
41+ the cities shall be taken
42Moab shall be + destroyed and be no longer a people,
43+ Terror, pit, and snare
44He who flees from the terror
45“In the shadow of Heshbon
46+ Woe to you, O Moab!
47+ Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab
