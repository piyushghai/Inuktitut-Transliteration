1Rejoice not, O Israel!
2+ Threshing floor and wine vat shall not feed them,
3They shall not remain in + the land of the Lord,
4+ They shall not pour drink offerings of wine to the Lord,
5+ What will you do on the day of the appointed festival,
6For behold, they are going away from destruction;
7+ The days of punishment have come;
8The prophet is + the watchman of Ephraim with my God;
9+ They have deeply corrupted themselves
10Like grapes in the wilderness,
11Ephraim’s + glory shall fly away like a bird—
12+ Even if they bring up children,
13Ephraim, + as I have seen, was like a young palm+  planted in a meadow;
14Give them, O Lord—
15Every evil of theirs is in + Gilgal;
16Ephraim is stricken;
17+ My God will reject them
