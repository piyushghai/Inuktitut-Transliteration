1“If you return, O Israel,
2+ and if you swear, ‘As the Lord lives,’
3For thus says the Lord to the men of Judah and Jerusalem:
4+ Circumcise yourselves to the Lord;
5Declare in Judah, and proclaim in Jerusalem, and say,
6+ Raise a standard toward Zion,
7+ A lion has gone up from his thicket,
8For this + put on sackcloth,
9“In that day, declares the Lord, + courage shall fail both king and officials. The priests shall be appalled and the prophets astounded.” 
10Then I said, “Ah, Lord God, + surely you have utterly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, ‘It shall be well with you,’ whereas the sword has reached their very life.”
11At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, “A hot wind from + the bare heights in the desert toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow or cleanse, 
12a wind too full for this comes for me. Now it is I who + speak in judgment upon them.”
13Behold, he comes up like clouds;
14O Jerusalem, + wash your heart from evil,
15For a voice + declares from Dan
16Warn the nations that he is coming;
17Like keepers of a field + are they against her all around,
18Your ways and your deeds
19+ My anguish, my anguish! I writhe in pain!
20+ Crash follows hard on crash;
21How long must I see the standard
22“For + my people are foolish;
23I looked on the earth, and behold, it was + without form and void;
24I looked on + the mountains, and behold, they were quaking,
25+ I looked, and behold, there was no man,
26I looked, and behold, the + fruitful land was a desert,
27For thus says the Lord, “The whole land shall be a desolation; + yet I will not make a full end.
28+ “For this the earth shall mourn,
29At the noise of horseman and archer
30And you, O desolate one,
31For I heard + a cry as of a woman in labor,
