1Then I heard a loud voice from the temple telling + the seven angels, “Go and + pour out on the earth + the seven bowls of the wrath of God.”
2So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth, and harmful and painful + sores came upon the people who bore + the mark of the beast and worshiped its image.
3The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and + it became like the blood of a corpse, and + every living thing died that was in the sea.
4The third angel poured out his bowl into + the rivers and the springs of water, and + they became blood. 
5And I heard the angel in charge of the waters+  say,
6For + they have shed the blood of + saints and prophets,
7And I heard + the altar saying,
8The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was allowed to scorch people + with fire. 
9They were scorched by the fierce heat, and + they cursed+  the name of God who had power over these plagues. + They did not repent + and give him glory.
10The fifth angel poured out his bowl on + the throne of the beast, and + its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their tongues in anguish 
11and cursed + the God of heaven for their pain and + sores. + They did not repent of their deeds.
12The sixth angel poured out his bowl on + the great river Euphrates, and + its water was dried up, + to prepare the way for the kings + from the east. 
13And I saw, coming out of the mouth of + the dragon and out of the mouth of + the beast and out of the mouth of + the false prophet, three + unclean spirits like + frogs. 
14For they are + demonic spirits, + performing signs, who go abroad to the kings of the whole world, + to assemble them for battle on + the great day of God the Almighty. 
15(“Behold, + I am coming like a thief! + Blessed is the one who stays awake, keeping his garments on, + that he may not go about naked and be seen exposed!”)
16And + they assembled them at the place that in Hebrew is called + Armageddon.
17The seventh angel poured out his bowl into + the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple, from the throne, saying, + “It is done!” 
18And there were + flashes of lightning, rumblings,+  peals of thunder, and + a great earthquake + such as there had never been since man was on the earth, so great was that earthquake. 
19+ The great city + was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell, and God + remembered + Babylon the great, + to make her drain the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath. 
20And + every island fled away, and no mountains were to be found. 
21And + great hailstones, about one hundred pounds+  each, fell from heaven on people; and + they cursed God for + the plague of the hail, because the plague was so severe.
