1Paul, + Silvanus, and Timothy,
2+ We give thanks to God always for all of you, constantly+ + mentioning you in our prayers, 
3remembering before + our God and Father + your work of faith and labor of + love and + steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. 
4For we know, + brothers+  loved by God, + that he has chosen you, 
5because + our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power and + in the Holy Spirit and with full + conviction. You know + what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake. 
6And + you became imitators of us + and of the Lord, for + you received the word in much affliction, + with the + joy of the Holy Spirit, 
7so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia. 
8For not only has the word of the Lord + sounded forth from you in Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith in God has gone forth + everywhere, so that we need not say anything. 
9For they themselves report concerning us the kind of + reception we had among you, and how + you turned to God + from idols to serve the living and + true God, 
10and + to wait for his Son + from heaven, + whom he raised from the dead, Jesus + who delivers us from + the wrath to come.
