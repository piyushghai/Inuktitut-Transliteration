1+  But there will be no + gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time he + brought into contempt the land of + Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time he + has made glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.+ 
2+ + The people + who walked in darkness
3+ You have multiplied the nation;
4+ For the yoke of his burden,
5+ For every boot of the tramping warrior in battle tumult
6+ For to us a child is born,
7Of the increase of his government and of peace
8The Lord has sent a word against Jacob,
9and all the people will know,
10â€œThe bricks have fallen,
11But the Lord raises the adversaries of Rezin against him,
12+ The Syrians on the east and + the Philistines on the west
13The people + did not turn to him who struck them,
14So the Lord cut off from Israel + head and tail,
15+ the elder and honored man is the head,
16for those who guide this people have been leading them astray,
17Therefore the Lord does not + rejoice over their young men,
18For wickedness burns like + a fire;
19Through the wrath of the Lord of hosts
20+ They slice meat on the right, but are still hungry,
21Manasseh devours Ephraim, and Ephraim devours Manasseh;
