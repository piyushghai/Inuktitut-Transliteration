3David also defeated + Hadadezer king of + Zobah-Hamath, as he went to set up his monument+  at the river Euphrates.

6Then David put garrisons+  in Syria of Damascus, and the Syrians became servants to David and brought tribute. And the Lord gave victory to David+  wherever he went. 
7And David took the shields of gold that were carried by the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem. 
8And from + Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took a large amount of bronze. + With it Solomon made the bronze sea and the pillars and the vessels of bronze.
9When + Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the whole army of Hadadezer, king + of Zobah, 
10he sent his son + Hadoram to King David, to ask about his health and to bless him because he had fought against + Hadadezer and defeated him; for + Hadadezer had often been at war with Tou. And he sent all sorts of articles of gold, of silver, and of bronze. 
11These also King David dedicated to the Lord, together with the silver and gold that he had carried off from all the nations, from + Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, and Amalek.
