1The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning + the drought:
2+ “Judah mourns,
3Her nobles send their servants for water;
4Because of the ground that is dismayed,
5Even + the doe in the field forsakes her newborn fawn
6+ The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights;
7“Though our iniquities testify against us,
8+ O you hope of Israel,
9Why should you be like a man confused,
10Thus says the Lord concerning this people:
11The Lord said to me: + “Do not pray for the welfare of this people. 
12Though they fast, I will not hear their cry, + and though they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I will not accept them. But I will consume them + by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.”
13Then I said: “Ah, Lord God, behold, the prophets + say to them, ‘You shall not see the sword, nor shall you have famine, but I will give you assured peace in this place.’” 
14And the Lord said to me: “The + prophets are prophesying lies in my name. + I did not send them, nor did I command them or speak to them. They are prophesying to you a lying vision, + worthless divination, and + the deceit of their own minds. 
15Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name although + I did not send them, and who say, + ‘Sword and famine shall not come upon this land’: + By sword and famine those prophets shall be consumed. 
16And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem, victims of famine and sword, + with none to bury them—them, their wives, their sons, and their daughters. For I will pour out their evil upon them.
17“You shall say to them this word:
18+ If I go out into the field,
19+ Have you utterly rejected Judah?
20+ We acknowledge our wickedness, O Lord,
21Do not spurn us, + for your name’s sake;
22Are there any among + the false gods of the nations + that can bring rain?
