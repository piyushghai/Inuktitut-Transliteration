1In the fifteenth year of the reign of + Tiberius Caesar, + Pontius Pilate + being governor of Judea, and + Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, 
2during + the high priesthood of Annas and + Caiaphas, + the word of God came to + John the son of Zechariah in + the wilderness. 
3And he went into all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming + a baptism of repentance + for the forgiveness of sins. 
4As it is written in + the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet,
5+ Every valley shall be filled,
6+ and all flesh shall see + the salvation of God.’”
7He said therefore to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, + “You brood of + vipers! Who warned you to flee from + the wrath to come? 
8Bear fruits + in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, + ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you, God is able from + these stones to raise up children for Abraham. 
9Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. + Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.”
10And the crowds asked him, + “What then shall we do?” 
11And he answered them, + “Whoever has two tunics+  is to share with him who has none, and whoever has food is to do likewise.” 
12+ Tax collectors also came to be baptized and said to him, “Teacher, + what shall we do?” 
13And he said to them, + “Collect no more than you are authorized to do.” 
14Soldiers also asked him, “And we, + what shall we do?” And he said to them, + “Do not extort money from anyone by threats or by false accusation, and be content with your + wages.”
15As the people were in expectation, and all were questioning in their hearts concerning John, + whether he might be + the Christ, 
16+ John answered them all, saying, “I baptize you with water, but + he who is mightier than I is coming, + the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you + with the Holy Spirit and + fire. 
17His + winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor and to + gather the wheat into his barn, + but the chaff he will burn with + unquenchable fire.”
18So + with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people. 
19But + Herod the tetrarch, who had been reproved by him for Herodias, his brother’s wife, and for all the evil things that Herod had done, 
20added this to them all, that + he locked up John in prison.
21Now when all the people were baptized, and when + Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, + the heavens were opened, 
22and + the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form, like a dove; and + a voice came from heaven, + “You are my beloved Son;+  with you I am well pleased.”+ 
23Jesus, + when he began his ministry, was about + thirty years of age, being + the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli, 
24the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph, 
25the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai, 
26the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda, 
27the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, + the son of Zerubbabel, the son + of Shealtiel,+  the son of Neri, 
28the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er, 
29the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, 
30the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim, 
31the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of + Nathan, the son of David, 
32+ the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Sala, the son of Nahshon, 
33the son of Amminadab, the son of Admin, the son of Arni, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah, 
34+ the son of Jacob, + the son of Isaac, + the son of Abraham, + the son of Terah, the son of Nahor, 
35the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah, 
36the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech, 
37the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan, 
38the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.
