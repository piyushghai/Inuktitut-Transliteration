1Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains. And the mountains were mountains of + bronze. 
2The first chariot had + red horses, the second + black horses, 
3the third + white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled horses—all of them strong.+ 
4Then I answered and said to + the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?” 
5And the angel answered and said to me, + “These are going out to the four winds of heaven, after + presenting themselves before + the Lord of all the earth. 
6The chariot with the black horses goes toward + the north country, the white ones go after them, and the dappled ones go toward + the south country.” 
7When the strong horses came out, they were impatient to go and + patrol the earth. And he said, “Go, + patrol the earth.” + So they patrolled the earth. 
8Then he cried to me, “Behold, those who go toward + the north country have set my Spirit at rest in + the north country.”
9And the word of the Lord came to me: 
10“Take from the exiles + Heldai, Tobijah, and + Jedaiah, who have arrived from Babylon, and go the same day to the house of Josiah, the son of + Zephaniah. 
11Take from them silver and gold, and make a crown, + and set it on the head of + Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. 
12And say to him, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, “Behold, the man whose name is + the Branch: for he shall branch out from his place, and + he shall build the temple of the Lord. 
13+ It is he who shall build the temple of the Lord + and shall bear royal honor, and shall sit and rule on his throne. And there shall be a + priest on his throne, + and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.”’ 
14And the crown shall be in the temple of the Lord as + a reminder to + Helem,+ + Tobijah, + Jedaiah, and Hen + the son of Zephaniah.
15+ “And those who are far off shall come and + help to build the temple of the Lord. + And you shall know that the Lord of hosts has sent me to you. + And this shall come to pass, if you will diligently obey the voice of the Lord your God.”
