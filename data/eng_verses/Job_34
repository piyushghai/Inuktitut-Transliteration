1Then Elihu answered and said:
2“Hear my words, you wise men,
3for + the ear tests words
4Let us choose + what is right;
5For Job has said, ‘I am + in the right,
6in spite of my right I am counted a liar;
7What man is like Job,
8who travels in company with evildoers
9For + he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing
10“Therefore, hear me, you men of understanding:
11For according to + the work of a man he will repay him,
12Of a truth, God will not do wickedly,
13Who gave him charge over the earth,
14If he should + set his heart to it
15all flesh would perish together,
16“If you have understanding, hear this;
17+ Shall one who hates justice govern?
18who + says to a king, ‘Worthless one,’
19who + shows no partiality to princes,
20In a moment + they die;
21“For his eyes are on + the ways of a man,
22There is no + gloom or + deep darkness
23For God+  has no need to consider a man further,
24He + shatters the mighty without investigation
25Thus, knowing their works,
26He strikes them for their wickedness
27because they turned aside from + following him
28so that they + caused the cry of the poor to come to him,
29When he is quiet, who can condemn?
30that a godless man should not reign,
31“For has anyone said to God,
32+ teach me what I do not see;
33Will he then make repayment to suit you,
34Men of understanding will say to me,
35‘Job + speaks without knowledge;
36Would that Job were tried to the end,
37For he adds rebellion to his sin;
