1And the Lord+ said to Job:
2“Shall a faultfinder + contend with the Almighty?
3Then Job answered the Lord and said:
4“Behold, I am + of small account; what shall I answer you?
5I have spoken + once, and I will not answer;
6Then the Lord+ answered Job out of the whirlwind and said:
7+ “Dress for action+  like a man;
8Will you even put me in the wrong?
9Have you + an arm like God,
10“Adorn yourself with majesty and dignity;
11Pour out the overflowings of your anger,
12Look on everyone who is proud and bring him low
13+ Hide them all in + the dust together;
14Then will I also acknowledge to you
15“Behold, Behemoth,+ 
16Behold, his strength in his loins,
17He makes his tail stiff like a cedar;
18His bones are tubes of bronze,
19“He is + the first of + the works+  of God;
20For the mountains yield food for him
21Under the lotus plants he lies,
22For his shade the lotus trees cover him;
23Behold, if the river is turbulent he is not frightened;
24Can one take him by his eyes,+
