1+ In you, O Lord, do I + take refuge;
2Incline your ear to me;
3For you are my rock and my fortress;
4you + take me out of + the net they have hidden for me,
5+ Into your hand I commit my spirit;
6I + hate+  those who pay + regard to worthless + idols,
7I will rejoice and be glad in your steadfast love,
8and you have not + delivered me into the hand of the enemy;
9Be gracious to me, O Lord, for I am + in distress;
10For my life is spent with sorrow,
11Because of all my adversaries I have become + a reproach,
12I have been + forgotten like one who is dead;
13For I + hear the whispering of manyâ€”
14But I + trust in you, O Lord;
15My + times are in your hand;
16+ Make your face shine on your servant;
17O Lord, + let me not be put to shame,
18Let the lying lips be mute,
19Oh, how abundant is your goodness,
20In + the cover of your presence you hide them
21Blessed be the Lord,
22I had said in my + alarm,+ 
23Love the Lord, all you his + saints!
24+ Be strong, and let your heart take courage,
