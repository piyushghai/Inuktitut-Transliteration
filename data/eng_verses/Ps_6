1O Lord, + rebuke me not in your anger,
2Be gracious to me, O Lord, for I am languishing;
3My + soul also is greatly troubled.
4Turn, O Lord, deliver my life;
5For in + death there is no remembrance of you;
6I am + weary with my + moaning;
7My + eye wastes away because of grief;
8+ Depart from me, all you + workers of evil,
9The Lord has heard my + plea;
10All my enemies shall be ashamed and greatly troubled;
