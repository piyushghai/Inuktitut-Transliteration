1For behold, the + Lord God of hosts
2+ the mighty man and the soldier,
3the captain of fifty
4+ And I will make boys their princes,
5+ And the people will oppress one another,
6For + a man will take hold of his brother
7in that day he will speak out, saying:
8For Jerusalem has stumbled,
9For the look on their faces bears witness against them;
10+ Tell the righteous that it shall be well with them,
11+ Woe to the wicked! It shall be ill with him,
12My peopleâ€”+ infants are their oppressors,
13The Lord+ has taken his place to contend;
14The Lord will enter into judgment
15What do you mean by + crushing my people,
16The Lord said:
17therefore the Lord + will strike with a scab
18In that day the Lord will take away + the finery of the anklets, the + headbands, and the + crescents; 
19the pendants, the bracelets, and the scarves; 
20the + headdresses, the armlets, the sashes, the perfume boxes, and the amulets; 
21the signet rings and + nose rings; 
22the + festal robes, the mantles, the cloaks, and the handbags; 
23the mirrors, the linen garments, the turbans, and the veils.
24Instead of + perfume there will be rottenness;
25Your men shall fall by the sword
26And + her gates shall lament and mourn;
