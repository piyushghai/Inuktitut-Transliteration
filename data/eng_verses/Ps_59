1+ Deliver me from my enemies, O my God;
2deliver me from + those who work evil,
3For behold, they + lie in wait for my life;
4for no fault of mine, they run and make ready.
5You, + Lord God of hosts, are God of Israel.
6Each evening they + come back,
7There they are, + bellowing with their mouths
8But you, O Lord, + laugh at them;
9O my Strength, I will watch for you,
10+ My God in his steadfast love+ + will meet me;
11Kill them not, lest my people forget;
12For + the sin of their mouths, the words of their lips,
13+ consume them in wrath;
14+ Each evening they come back,
15They + wander about for food
16But I will sing of your strength;
17O my Strength, I will sing praises to you,
