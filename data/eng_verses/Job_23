1Then Job answered and said:
2“Today also my + complaint is bitter;+ 
3Oh, + that I knew where I might find him,
4I would + lay my case before him
5I would know what he would answer me
6Would he + contend with me in the greatness of his power?
7There an upright man could argue with him,
8“Behold, + I go forward, but he is not there,
9on the left hand when he is working, I do not behold him;
10But he + knows + the way that I + take;
11My foot + has held fast to his steps;
12I have not departed from the commandment of his lips;
13But he is unchangeable,+  and + who can turn him back?
14For he will complete what he + appoints for me,
15Therefore I am terrified at his presence;
16God has made my + heart faint;
17yet I am not silenced because of the darkness,
