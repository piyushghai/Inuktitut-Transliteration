1Then + I saw another sign in heaven, great and amazing, + seven angels with seven plagues, which are the last, for with them the wrath of God is finished.
2And I saw + what appeared to be a sea of glass mingled with fireâ€”and also those + who had conquered the beast and its image and + the number of its name, standing beside the sea of glass + with harps of God in their hands. 
3And they sing + the song of Moses, + the servant+  of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying,
4+ Who will not fear, O Lord,
5After this I looked, and + the sanctuary of + the tent+  of witness in heaven was opened, 
6and out of the sanctuary came + the seven angels with the seven plagues, clothed in pure, bright + linen, + with golden sashes around their chests. 
7And one of + the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven + golden bowls full of the wrath of God + who lives forever and ever, 
8and + the sanctuary was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and + no one could enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.
