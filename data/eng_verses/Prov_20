1+ Wine is a mocker, + strong drink a brawler,
2The terror of a king is like + the growling of a lion;
3It is an honor for a man to + keep aloof from strife,
4+ The sluggard does not plow in the autumn;
5The purpose in a man’s heart is like + deep water,
6Many a man + proclaims his own steadfast love,
7The righteous who + walks in his integrity—
8+ A king who sits on the throne of judgment
9+ Who can say, “I have made my heart pure;
10+ Unequal+  weights and unequal measures
11Even a child + makes himself known by his acts,
12+ The hearing ear and the seeing eye,
13+ Love not sleep, lest you + come to poverty;
14“Bad, bad,” says the buyer,
15There is gold and abundance of + costly stones,
16+ Take a man’s garment when he has put up security for a stranger,
17+ Bread gained by deceit is sweet to a man,
18+ Plans are established by counsel;
19Whoever + goes about slandering reveals secrets;
20+ If one curses his father or his mother,
21+ An inheritance gained hastily in the beginning
22Do not say, + “I will repay evil”;
23+ Unequal weights are an abomination to the Lord,
24A man’s + steps are from the Lord;
25It is a snare to say rashly, “It is holy,”
26A wise king + winnows the wicked
27+ The spirit+  of man is the lamp of the Lord,
28+ Steadfast love and faithfulness preserve the king,
29The glory of young men is their strength,
30+ Blows that wound cleanse away evil;
