1+ Praise the Lord!
2who + stand in the house of the Lord,
3Praise the Lord, for + the Lord is good;
4For the Lord has + chosen Jacob for himself,
5For I know that + the Lord is great,
6+ Whatever the Lord pleases, he does,
7+ He it is who makes the clouds rise at the end of the earth,
8He it was who + struck down the firstborn of Egypt,
9who in your midst, O Egypt,
10+ who struck down many nations
11+ Sihon, king of the Amorites,
12and + gave their land as a heritage,
13+ Your name, O Lord, endures forever,
14+ For the Lord will vindicate his people
15+ The idols of the nations are silver and gold,
16They have mouths, but do not speak;
17they have ears, but do not hear,
18Those who make them become like them,
19+ O house of Israel, bless the Lord!
20O house of Levi, bless the Lord!
21Blessed be the Lord+ from Zion,
