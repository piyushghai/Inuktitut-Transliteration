1+ Come down and sit in the dust,
2Take the millstones and + grind flour,
3Your nakedness shall be uncovered,
4+ Our Redeemer—the Lord of hosts is his name—
5+ Sit in silence, and go into darkness,
6+ I was angry with my people;
7You said, “I shall be + mistress forever,”
8Now therefore hear this, + you lover of pleasures,
9+ These two things shall come to you
10You felt secure in your wickedness,
11But evil shall come upon you,
12+ Stand fast in your enchantments
13You are wearied with your many counsels;
14Behold, + they are like stubble;
15Such to you are those with whom you have labored,
