1Hear this word that I + take up over you in lamentation, O house of Israel:
2“Fallen, no more to rise,
3For thus says the Lord God:
4For thus says the Lord to the house of Israel:
5but do not seek + Bethel,
6+ Seek the Lord and live,
7O + you who turn justice to wormwood+ 
8He who made the + Pleiades and Orion,
9+ who makes destruction flash forth against the strong,
10+ They hate him who reproves + in the gate,
11Therefore because you + trample on+  the poor
12For I know how many are your transgressions
13Therefore he who is prudent will + keep silent in such a time,
14+ Seek good, and not evil,
15+ Hate evil, and love good,
16Therefore thus says the Lord, + the God of hosts, the Lord:
17and in all vineyards there shall be wailing,
18Woe to you who desire + the day of the Lord!
19+ as if a man fled from a lion,
20+ Is not the day of the Lord darkness, and not light,
21+ “I hate, I despise your feasts,
22+ Even though you offer me your burnt offerings and grain offerings,
23Take away from me the noise of your songs;
24But let justice roll down like waters,
25+ “Did you bring to me sacrifices and offerings during the forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel? 
26+ You + shall take up Sikkuth your king, and Kiyyun your star-god—your images that you made for yourselves, 
27+ and I will send you into exile beyond Damascus,” says the Lord, whose name is + the God of hosts.
