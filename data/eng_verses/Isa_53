1+ Who has believed what he has heard from us?+ 
2For he grew up before him like a young plant,
3+ He was despised and rejected+  by men;
4+ Surely he has borne our griefs
5+ But he was pierced for our transgressions;
6+ All we like sheep have gone astray;
7He was oppressed, and he was afflicted,
8By oppression and judgment he was taken away;
9And they made his grave with the wicked
10Yet + it was the will of the Lord to crush him;
11Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see+  and be satisfied;
12+ Therefore I will divide him a portion with the many,+
