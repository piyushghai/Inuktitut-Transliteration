1+ I give you thanks, O Lord, with my whole heart;
2I bow down + toward your + holy temple
3On the day I called, you answered me;
4+ All the kings of the earth shall give you thanks, O Lord,
5and they shall sing of + the ways of the Lord,
6+ For though the Lord is high, he regards the lowly,
7+ Though I walk in the midst of trouble,
8The Lord will + fulfill his purpose for me;
