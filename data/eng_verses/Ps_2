1+ Why do + the nations rage+ 
2The kings of the earth set themselves,
3“Let us + burst their bonds apart
4He who + sits in the heavens + laughs;
5Then he will speak to them in his + wrath,
6“As for me, I have + set my King
7I will tell of the decree:
8Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage,
9You shall + break+  them with + a rod of iron
10Now therefore, O kings, be wise;
11+ Serve the Lord with + fear,
12+ Kiss + the Son,
