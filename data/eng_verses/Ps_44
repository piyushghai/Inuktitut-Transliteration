1O God, we have heard with our ears,
2you with your own hand + drove out the nations,
3for not + by their own sword did they win the land,
4+ You are my King, O God;
5Through you we + push down our foes;
6For not in + my bow do I trust,
7But you have saved us from our foes
8+ In God we have boasted continually,
9But you have + rejected us and disgraced us
10You have made us + turn back from the foe,
11You have made us like + sheep for slaughter
12+ You have sold your people for a trifle,
13You have made us + the taunt of our neighbors,
14You have made us + a byword among the nations,
15All day long my disgrace is before me,
16at the sound of the taunter and reviler,
17+ All this has come upon us,
18Our heart has not turned back,
19yet you have + broken us in the place of + jackals
20If we had forgotten the name of our God
21+ would not God discover this?
22Yet + for your sake we are killed all the day long;
23+ Awake! Why are you sleeping, O Lord?
24Why + do you hide your face?
25For our + soul is bowed down to the dust;
26Rise up; + come to our help!
