1An + oracle concerning + Egypt.
2And I will stir up Egyptians against Egyptians,
3and the spirit of the Egyptians within them will be emptied out,
4and I will give over the Egyptians
5And the waters of the sea will be dried up,
6and its canals will become foul,
7There will be bare places by the Nile,
8The + fishermen will mourn and lament,
9The workers in + combed flax will be in despair,
10Those who are the + pillars of the land will be crushed,
11The princes of + Zoan are utterly foolish;
12Where then are your + wise men?
13The princes of + Zoan have become fools,
14The Lord has mingled within her + a spirit of confusion,
15And there will be nothing for Egypt
16In that day the Egyptians will be + like women, and + tremble with fear before the hand that the Lord of hosts shakes over them. 
17And the land of Judah will become a terror to the Egyptians. Everyone to whom it is mentioned will fear because of the purpose that the Lord of hosts has purposed against them.
18+ In that day there will be + five cities in the land of Egypt that + speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the Lord of hosts. One of these will be called the City of Destruction.+ 
19In that day there will be an + altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a + pillar to the Lord at its border. 
20+ It will be a sign and a witness to the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt. When they cry to the Lord because of oppressors, + he will send them a savior and defender, and deliver them. 
21+ And the Lord will make himself known to the Egyptians, and the Egyptians will know the Lord in that day + and worship with sacrifice and offering, and they will make vows to the Lord and perform them. 
22+ And the Lord will strike Egypt, striking and healing, and they will return to the Lord, and he will listen to their pleas for mercy and heal them.
23+ In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and Assyria will come into Egypt, and Egypt into Assyria, + and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.
24In that day Israel will be the third with Egypt and Assyria, + a blessing in the midst of the earth, 
25whom the Lord of hosts has blessed, saying, “Blessed be Egypt + my people, and Assyria + the work of my hands, and + Israel my inheritance.”
