1Woe to + those who go down to Egypt for help
2And + yet he is wise and brings disaster;
3The Egyptians are man, and not God,
4For thus the Lord said to me,
5+ Like birds hovering, so the Lord of hosts
6+ Turn to him from whom people+  have + deeply revolted, O children of Israel. 
7For in that day + everyone shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which your hands have sinfully made for you.
8+ â€œAnd the Assyrian shall fall by a sword, not of man;
9+ His rock shall pass away in terror,
