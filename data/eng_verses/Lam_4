1+ How the gold has grown dim,
2The precious sons of Zion,
3Even jackals offer the breast;
4The tongue of the nursing infant + sticks
5Those who once feasted on delicacies
6+ For the chastisement+  of the daughter of my people has been greater
7Her princes were purer than snow,
8+ Now their face is blacker than soot;
9Happier were the victims of the sword
10+ The hands of + compassionate women
11+ The Lord gave full vent to his wrath;
12+ The kings of the earth did not believe,
13This was for + the sins of her prophets
14+ They wandered, blind, through the streets;
15“Away! + Unclean!” people cried at them.
16+ The Lord himself+  has scattered them;
17+ Our eyes failed, ever watching
18+ They dogged our steps
19Our pursuers were + swifter
20+ The breath of our nostrils, + the Lord’s anointed,
21+ Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom,
22+ The punishment of your iniquity, O daughter of Zion, is accomplished;
