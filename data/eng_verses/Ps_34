1+  I will bless the Lord + at all times;
2My soul + makes its boast in the Lord;
3Oh, + magnify the Lord with me,
4I + sought the Lord, and he answered me
5Those who look to him are + radiant,
6+ This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him
7+ The angel of the Lord+ encamps
8Oh, + taste and see that + the Lord is good!
9Oh, fear the Lord, you his saints,
10+ The young lions suffer want and hunger;
11+ Come, O children, listen to me;
12+ What man is there who desires life
13+ Keep your tongue from evil
14+ Turn away from evil and do good;
15+ The eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous
16+ The face of the Lord is against those who do evil,
17+ When the righteous cry for help, the Lord hears
18The Lord is near to + the brokenhearted
19+ Many are the afflictions of the righteous,
20He keeps all his bones;
21+ Affliction will slay the wicked,
22The Lord+ redeems the life of his servants;
