1+ Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, + we+  have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
2Through him we have also + obtained access by faith+  into this grace + in which we stand, and + we+  rejoice+  in hope of the glory of God. 
3Not only that, but we + rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering + produces endurance, 
4and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, 
5and + hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love + has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.
6For + while we were still weak, at the right time + Christ died for the ungodly. 
7For one will scarcely die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die— 
8but + God shows his love for us in that + while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 
9Since, therefore, + we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from + the wrath of God. 
10For if + while we were enemies + we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by + his life. 
11More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received + reconciliation.
12Therefore, just as + sin came into the world through one man, and + death through sin, and + so death spread to all men+  because + all sinned— 
13for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but + sin is not counted where there is no law. 
14Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sinning was not + like the transgression of Adam, + who was a type of + the one who was to come.
15But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if many died through one man’s trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for + many. 
16And the free gift is not like the result of that one man’s sin. For + the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought + justification. 
17For if, because of one man’s trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness + reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.
18Therefore, as one trespass+  led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness+  leads to justification and life for + all men. 
19For as by the one man’s + disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man’s + obedience the many will be made righteous. 
20Now + the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, + grace abounded all the more, 
21so that, + as sin reigned in death, + grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
