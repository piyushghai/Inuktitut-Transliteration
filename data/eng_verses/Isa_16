1+ Send the lamb to the ruler of the land,
2Like fleeing birds,
3“Give counsel;
4let + the outcasts of Moab
5+ then a throne will be established in steadfast love,
6+ We have heard of the pride of Moab—
7Therefore let Moab wail for Moab,
8For the fields of Heshbon languish,
9Therefore + I weep with + the weeping of Jazer
10+ And joy and gladness are taken away from + the fruitful field,
11Therefore + my inner parts moan like a lyre for Moab,
12And when Moab presents himself, when + he wearies himself on + the high place, when he comes to his sanctuary to pray, he will not prevail.
13This is the word that the Lord spoke concerning Moab + in the past. 
14But now the Lord has spoken, saying, “In three years, + like the years of a hired worker, the glory of Moab will be brought into contempt, in spite of all his great multitude, and those who remain will be + very few and feeble.”
