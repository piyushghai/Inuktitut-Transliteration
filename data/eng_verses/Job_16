1Then Job answered and said:
2“I have heard + many such things;
3Shall + windy words have an end?
4I also could speak as you do,
5I could strengthen you with my mouth,
6“If I speak, my pain is not assuaged,
7Surely now God has worn me out;
8And he has shriveled me up,
9He has + torn me in his wrath + and hated me;
10Men have + gaped at me with their mouth;
11God gives me up to the ungodly
12I was at ease, and he broke me apart;
13his + archers surround me.
14He breaks me with + breach upon breach;
15I have sewed + sackcloth upon my skin
16My face is red with weeping,
17although there is no + violence in my hands,
18“O earth, + cover not my blood,
19Even now, behold, my + witness is in heaven,
20My friends + scorn me;
21that he would + argue the case of a man with God,
22For when a few years have come
