1Oh sing to the Lord+ a new song,
2The Lord has + made known his salvation;
3He has + remembered his + steadfast love and faithfulness
4+ Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth;
5Sing praises to the Lord with the lyre,
6With + trumpets and the sound of + the horn
7+ Let the sea roar, and + all that fills it;
8Let the rivers + clap their hands;
9before the Lord, for he comes
