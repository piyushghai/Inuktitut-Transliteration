1Like snow in summer or + rain in harvest,
2Like + a sparrow in its flitting, like a swallow in its flying,
3+ A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey,
4+ Answer not a fool according to his folly,
5+ Answer a fool according to his folly,
6Whoever sends a message by the hand of a fool
7Like a lame man’s legs, which hang useless,
8Like one who binds the stone in the sling
9Like + a thorn that goes up into the hand of a drunkard
10Like an archer who wounds everyone
11Like + a dog that returns to his vomit
12Do you see a man who is + wise in his own eyes?
13+ The sluggard says, “There is a lion in the road!
14As a door turns on its hinges,
15+ The sluggard buries his hand in the dish;
16The sluggard is + wiser in his own eyes
17Whoever meddles in a quarrel not his own
18Like a madman who throws + firebrands, arrows, and death
19is the man who deceives his neighbor
20For lack of wood the fire goes out,
21As charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire,
22+ The words of + a whisperer are like delicious morsels;
23+ Like the + glaze+  covering an earthen vessel
24Whoever hates disguises himself with his lips
25+ when he speaks graciously, believe him not,
26though his hatred be covered with deception,
27+ Whoever digs a pit will fall into it,
28A lying tongue hates its victims,
