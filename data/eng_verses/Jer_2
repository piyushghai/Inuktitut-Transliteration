1The word of the Lord came to me, saying, 
2“Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem, Thus says the Lord,
3+ Israel was holy to the Lord,
4Hear the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, and all the clans of the house of Israel. 
5Thus says the Lord:
6They did not say, + ‘Where is the Lord
7+ And I brought you into a plentiful land
8The priests did not say, ‘Where is the Lord?’
9“Therefore + I still contend with you,
10For cross to the coasts of + Cyprus and see,
11+ Has a nation changed its gods,
12Be appalled, + O heavens, at this;
13for my people have committed two evils:
14+ “Is Israel a slave? Is he a homeborn servant?
15+ The lions have roared against him;
16Moreover, the men of + Memphis and + Tahpanhes
17+ Have you not brought this upon yourself
18+ And now what do you gain by going to Egypt
19+ Your evil will chastise you,
20“For long ago I + broke your yoke
21+ Yet I planted you a choice vine,
22Though you wash yourself with lye
23+ How can you say, ‘I am not unclean,
24+ a wild donkey used to the wilderness,
25Keep + your feet from going unshod
26“As a thief is shamed when caught,
27who say to a tree, ‘You are my father,’
28But + where are your gods
29“Why do you contend with me?
30In vain have I + struck your children;
31And you, O generation, behold the word of the Lord.
32+ Can a virgin forget her ornaments,
33“How well you direct your course
34Also on your skirts is found
35you say, ‘I am innocent;
36+ How much you go about,
37From it too you will come away
