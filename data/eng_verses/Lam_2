1How the Lord in his anger
2The Lord + has swallowed up + without mercy
3He has cut down in + fierce anger
4+ He has bent his bow like an enemy,
5+ The Lord has become like an enemy;
6He has laid waste his booth like a garden,
7+ The Lord has scorned his altar,
8+ The Lord determined to lay in ruins
9Her gates have sunk into the ground;
10The elders of the daughter of Zion
11+ My eyes are spent with weeping;
12They cry to their mothers,
13What can I say for you, + to what compare you,
14+ Your prophets have seen for you
15All who pass along the way
16+ All your enemies
17The Lord has done what he purposed;
18Their heart cried to the Lord.
19â€œArise, + cry out in the night,
20Look, O Lord, and see!
21In the dust of the streets
22You summoned as if to + a festival day
