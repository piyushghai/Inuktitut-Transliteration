1+ Hear what the Lord says:
2+ Hear, you mountains, + the indictment of the Lord,
3“O my people, + what have I done to you?
4For + I brought you up from the land of Egypt
5O my people, remember + what Balak king of Moab devised,
6+ “With what shall I come before the Lord,
7+ Will the Lord be pleased with+  thousands of rams,
8He has told you, O man, what is good;
9The voice of the Lord cries to the city—
10Can I forget any longer the treasures+  of wickedness in the house of the wicked,
11Shall I acquit the man + with wicked scales
12Your+  rich men are + full of violence;
13Therefore I strike you with a grievous blow,
14+ You shall eat, but not be satisfied,
15+ You shall sow, but not reap;
16For you have kept the statutes of + Omri,+
