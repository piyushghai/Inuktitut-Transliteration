1O Lord, God of + vengeance,
2+ Rise up, O + judge of the earth;
3O Lord, + how long shall the wicked,
4They pour out their + arrogant words;
5They + crush your people, O Lord,
6They kill + the widow and the sojourner,
7+ and they say, “The Lord does not see;
8+ Understand, O dullest of the people!
9+ He who planted the ear, does he not hear?
10He who + disciplines the nations, does he not rebuke?
11+ the Lord—knows the thoughts of man,
12+ Blessed is the man whom you + discipline, O Lord,
13to give him + rest from + days of trouble,
14+ For the Lord will not forsake his + people;
15for + justice will return to the righteous,
16+ Who rises up for me against the wicked?
17+ If the Lord had not been my help,
18When I thought, + “My foot slips,”
19When the cares of my heart are many,
20Can + wicked rulers be allied with you,
21They + band together against the life of the righteous
22But the Lord has become my + stronghold,
23He will bring back on them + their iniquity
