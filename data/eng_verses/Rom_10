1Brothers,+  my heart’s desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved. 
2For I bear them witness that + they have a zeal for God, + but not according to knowledge. 
3For, being ignorant of + the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God’s righteousness. 
4For + Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.+ 
5For + Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law, that + the person who does the commandments shall live by them. 
6But + the righteousness based on faith says, + “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’” (that is, to bring Christ down) 
7“or ‘Who will descend into the + abyss?’” (that is, + to bring Christ up from the dead). 
8But what does it say? + “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim); 
9because, if + you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and + believe in your heart + that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 
10For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. 
11For the Scripture says, + “Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.” 
12+ For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; + for the same Lord is Lord of all, + bestowing his riches on all who call on him. 
13For + “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”
14How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him + of whom they have never heard?+  And how are they to hear + without someone preaching? 
15And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, + “How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!” 
16But + they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, + “Lord, who has believed what he has heard from us?” 
17So + faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.
18But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have, for
19But I ask, did Israel not understand? First Moses says,
20Then Isaiah is so bold as to say,
21But of Israel he says, + “All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.”
