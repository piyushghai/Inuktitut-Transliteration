1Truly God is good to + Israel,
2But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled,
3+ For I was + envious of the arrogant
4For they have no pangs until death;
5They are not in trouble as others are;
6Therefore pride is + their necklace;
7Their + eyes swell out through fatness;
8They scoff and + speak with malice;
9They set their mouths against the heavens,
10Therefore his people turn back to them,
11And they say, + “How can God know?
12Behold, these are the wicked;
13All in vain have I + kept my heart clean
14For all the day long I have been + stricken
15If I had said, “I will speak thus,”
16But when I thought how to understand this,
17until I went into + the sanctuary of God;
18Truly you set them in + slippery places;
19How they are destroyed + in a moment,
20Like + a dream when one awakes,
21When my soul was embittered,
22I was + brutish and ignorant;
23Nevertheless, I am continually with you;
24You + guide me with your counsel,
25+ Whom have I in heaven but you?
26+ My flesh and my heart may fail,
27For behold, those who are + far from you shall perish;
28But for me it is good to + be near God;
