1And they brought in the ark of God and set it inside + the tent that David had pitched for it, and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God. 
2And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord
3and distributed to all Israel, both men and women, to each a loaf of bread, a portion of meat,+  and a cake of raisins.
4Then he appointed some of the Levites as ministers before the ark of the Lord, to invoke, to thank, and to praise the Lord, the God of Israel. 
5+ Asaph was the chief, and second to him were Zechariah, Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel, who were to play harps and lyres; Asaph was to sound the cymbals, 
6and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests were to blow trumpets regularly before the ark of the covenant of God. 
7Then on that day + David first appointed that thanksgiving be sung to the Lord by Asaph and his brothers.
8+ Oh give thanks to the Lord; + call upon his name;
9Sing to him, sing praises to him;
10Glory in his holy name;
11+ Seek the Lord and his strength;
12+ Remember the wondrous works that he has done,
13O offspring of Israel his servant,
14He is the Lord our God;
15Remember his covenant forever,
16the covenant + that he made with Abraham,
17which + he confirmed to Jacob as a statute,
18saying, + “To you I will give the land of Canaan,
19When you were + few in number,
20wandering from nation to nation,
21he allowed no one to oppress them;
22saying, “Touch not my anointed ones,
23+ Sing to the Lord, all the earth!
24Declare his glory among the nations,
25For + great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised,
26For all the gods of the peoples are worthless idols,
27Splendor and majesty are before him;
28Ascribe to the Lord, O families of the peoples,
29Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name;
30tremble before him, all the earth;
31+ Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice,
32+ Let the sea roar, and all that fills it;
33Then shall the trees of the forest sing for joy
34Oh give thanks to the Lord, for he is good;
35+ Say also:
36+ Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,
37So David left Asaph and his brothers there + before the ark of the covenant of the Lord to minister regularly before the ark + as each day required, 
38and also + Obed-edom and his+  sixty-eight brothers, while + Obed-edom, the son of Jeduthun, and + Hosah were to be gatekeepers. 
39And he left + Zadok the priest and his brothers the priests before the tabernacle of the Lord + in the high place that was at Gibeon 
40to offer burnt offerings to the Lord + on the altar of burnt offering + regularly morning and evening, to do all that is written in the Law of the Lord that he commanded Israel. 
41With them were + Heman and Jeduthun + and the rest of those chosen and + expressly named to give thanks to the Lord, + for his steadfast love endures forever. 
42Heman and Jeduthun had trumpets and cymbals for the music and instruments + for sacred song. The sons of Jeduthun were appointed to the gate.
43+ Then all the people departed each to his house, and David went home to bless his household.
