1Save, O Lord, for + the godly one is gone;
2Everyone + utters lies to his neighbor;
3May the Lord cut off all + flattering lips,
4those who say, “With our tongue we will prevail,
5“Because + the poor are plundered, because the needy groan,
6+ The words of the Lord are pure words,
7You, O Lord, will keep them;
8On every side the wicked prowl,
