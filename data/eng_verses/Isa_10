1Woe to those who + decree iniquitous decrees,
2to turn aside the needy from justice
3What will you do on + the day of punishment,
4Nothing remains but to crouch among the prisoners
5Ah, Assyria, + the rod of my anger;
6Against a + godless nation I send him,
7But he + does not so intend,
8for he says:
9+ Is not + Calno like + Carchemish?
10As my hand has reached to + the kingdoms of the idols,
11shall I not do to Jerusalem and + her idols
12+ When the Lord has finished all his work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, + he+  will punish the speech of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria and the boastful look in his eyes. 
13+ For he says:
14My hand has found like a nest
15Shall + the axe boast over him who hews with it,
16Therefore the Lord God of hosts
17+ The light of Israel will become a fire,
18The glory of + his forest and of his + fruitful land
19The remnant of the trees of his forest will be so few
20+ In that day + the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no more + lean on him who struck them, but + will lean on the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, in truth. 
21A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, + to the mighty God. 
22+ For though your people Israel be as the sand of the sea, + only a remnant of them will return. + Destruction is decreed, overflowing with righteousness. 
23For the Lord God of hosts will make a full end, as decreed, in the midst of all the earth.
24Therefore thus says the Lord God of hosts: “O my people, + who dwell in Zion, + be not afraid of the Assyrians when they strike with the rod and lift up their staff against you as + the Egyptians did. 
25For + in a very little while my fury will come to an end, and my anger will be directed to their destruction. 
26And + the Lord of hosts will wield against them a whip, as when he struck + Midian + at the rock of Oreb. And his staff will be over the sea, and he will lift it + as he did in Egypt. 
27And in that day + his burden will depart from your shoulder, and + his yoke from your neck; and the yoke will be broken because of the fat.”+ 
28He has come to Aiath;
29they have crossed over + the pass;
30Cry aloud, O daughter of + Gallim!
31Madmenah is in flight;
32This very day he will halt at + Nob;
33Behold, the Lord God of hosts
34He will cut down + the thickets of the forest with an axe,
