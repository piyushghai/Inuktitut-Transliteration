1“My spirit is broken; my days are + extinct;
2Surely there are mockers about me,
3“Lay down a pledge for me with you;
4Since you have closed their hearts to understanding,
5He who informs against his friends to get a share of their property—
6“He has made me + a byword of the peoples,
7My + eye has grown dim from vexation,
8The upright are + appalled at this,
9Yet the righteous holds to his way,
10But you, + come on again, all of you,
11My + days are past; my plans are broken off,
12They + make night into day:
13If I hope for + Sheol as + my house,
14if I say to the pit, ‘You are my father,’
15where then is my hope?
16Will it go down to the bars of + Sheol?
