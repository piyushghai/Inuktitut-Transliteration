1+ A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches,
2+ The rich and the poor meet together;
3+ The prudent sees danger and hides himself,
4The reward for humility and fear of the Lord
5+ Thorns and snares are in the way of the crooked;
6+ Train up a child in the way he should go;
7+ The rich rules over the poor,
8Whoever + sows injustice will reap calamity,
9+ Whoever has a bountiful+  eye will be blessed,
10+ Drive out a scoffer, + and strife will go out,
11He who + loves purity of heart,
12The eyes of the Lord keep watch over knowledge,
13+ The sluggard says, â€œThere is a lion outside!
14The mouth of + forbidden+  women is + a deep pit;
15Folly is bound up in the heart of a child,
16Whoever oppresses the poor to increase his own wealth,
17+ Incline your ear, and hear + the words of the wise,
18for it will be pleasant if you keep them within you,
19That your trust may be in the Lord,
20Have I not written for you + thirty sayings
21to + make you know what is right and true,
22+ Do not rob the poor, because he is poor,
23for + the Lord will plead their cause
24Make no friendship with a man given to anger,
25lest you learn his ways
26Be not one of those who + give pledges,
27If you have nothing with which to pay,
28Do not move the ancient + landmark
29Do you see a man skillful in his work?
