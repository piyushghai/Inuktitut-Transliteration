1To you, O Lord, I call;
2+ Hear the voice of my pleas for mercy,
3Do not + drag me off with the wicked,
4+ Give to them according to their work
5Because they + do not regard the works of the Lord
6Blessed be the Lord!
7The Lord is my strength and + my shield;
8The Lord is the strength of his people;+ 
9Oh, save your people and bless + your heritage!
