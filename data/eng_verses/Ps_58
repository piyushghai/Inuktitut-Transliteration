1Do you indeed decree what is right, you gods?+ 
2No, in your hearts you devise wrongs;
3The wicked are + estranged from the womb;
4+ They have venom like the venom of a serpent,
5so that it + does not hear the voice of charmers
6O God, + break the teeth in their mouths;
7Let them + vanish like water that runs away;
8Let them be like the snail + that dissolves into slime,
9Sooner than your pots can feel the heat of + thorns,
10+ The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance;
11Mankind will say, â€œSurely there is + a reward for the righteous;
