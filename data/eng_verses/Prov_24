1Be not + envious of evil men,
2for their hearts + devise violence,
3By + wisdom a house is built,
4by knowledge the rooms are filled
5+ A wise man is full of strength,
6for by + wise guidance you can wage your war,
7Wisdom is + too high for a fool;
8Whoever + plans to do evil
9+ The devising+  of folly is sin,
10If you + faint in the day of adversity,
11+ Rescue those who are being taken away to death;
12If you say, “Behold, we did not know this,”
13My son, + eat honey, for it is good,
14Know that wisdom is such to your soul;
15+ Lie not in wait as a wicked man against the dwelling of the righteous;
16+ for the righteous falls + seven times and rises again,
17+ Do not rejoice when your enemy falls,
18lest the Lord see it and be displeased,
19+ Fret not yourself because of evildoers,
20for the evil man has no + future;
21My son, + fear the Lord and the king,
22for disaster will arise suddenly from them,
23These also are sayings of + the wise.
24Whoever + says to the wicked, “You are in the right,”
25but those who rebuke the wicked will have delight,
26Whoever gives an honest answer
27+ Prepare your work outside;
28+ Be not a witness against your neighbor without cause,
29Do not say, + “I will do to him as he has done to me;
30+ I passed by the field of a sluggard,
31and behold, it was all overgrown with thorns;
32Then I saw and + considered it;
33+ A little sleep, a little slumber,
34and poverty will come upon you like a robber,
