1After this Job + opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth. 
2And Job said:
3+ “Let the day perish on which I was born,
4Let that day be darkness!
5Let gloom and + deep darkness claim it.
6That night—let thick darkness seize it!
7Behold, let that night be barren;
8Let those curse it who curse the day,
9Let the stars of its dawn be dark;
10because it did not shut the doors of my mother’s womb,
11“Why + did I not die at birth,
12Why did + the knees receive me?
13For then I would have lain down and been quiet;
14with kings and counselors of the earth
15or with princes who had gold,
16Or why was I not as a hidden + stillborn child,
17There the wicked cease from troubling,
18There the prisoners are at ease together;
19The small and the great are there,
20“Why is light given to him who is in misery,
21who + long for death, but it comes not,
22who rejoice exceedingly
23Why is light given to a man whose + way is hidden,
24For my sighing comes + instead of+  my bread,
25+ For the thing that I fear comes upon me,
26I am not at ease, nor am I quiet;
