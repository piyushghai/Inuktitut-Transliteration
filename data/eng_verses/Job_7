1“Has not man + a hard service on earth,
2Like a slave who longs for + the shadow,
3so I am allotted months of + emptiness,
4+ When I lie down I say, ‘When shall I arise?’
5My flesh is clothed with + worms and + dirt;
6My days are + swifter than + a weaver’s shuttle
7“Remember that my life is a + breath;
8+ The eye of him who sees me will behold me no more;
9As + the cloud fades and vanishes,
10he + returns no more to his house,
11“Therefore I will not + restrain my mouth;
12Am I the sea, or + a sea monster,
13+ When I say, ‘My bed will comfort me,
14then you scare me with dreams
15so that I would choose strangling
16I + loathe my life; I would not live forever.
17+ What is man, that you make so much of him,
18+ visit him every morning
19How long will you not + look away from me,
20If I sin, what do I do to you, you watcher of mankind?
21Why do you not pardon my transgression
