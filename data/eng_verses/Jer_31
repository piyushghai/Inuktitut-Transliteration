1+ “At that time, declares the Lord, + I will be the God of all the clans of Israel, and they shall be my people.”
2Thus says the Lord:
3the Lord appeared to him+  from far away.
4+ Again I will build you, and you shall be built,
5+ Again you shall plant vineyards
6For there shall be a day when watchmen will call
7For thus says the Lord:
8Behold, I will bring them + from the north country
9+ With weeping they shall come,
10“Hear the word of the Lord, O nations,
11+ For the Lord has ransomed Jacob
12They shall come and sing aloud on the height of Zion,
13+ Then shall the young women rejoice in the dance,
14+ I will feast the soul of the priests with abundance,
15Thus says the Lord:
16Thus says the Lord:
17+ There is hope for your future,
18I have heard + Ephraim grieving,
19For after + I had turned away, I relented,
20+ Is Ephraim my dear son?
21+ “Set up road markers for yourself;
22+ How long will you waver,
23Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: “Once more they shall use these words in the land of Judah and in its cities, + when I restore their fortunes:
24+ And Judah and all its cities shall dwell there together, and + the farmers and those who wander with their flocks. 
25For I will + satisfy the weary soul, and every languishing soul I will replenish.”
26At this I awoke and looked, and my sleep was pleasant to me.
27+ “Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when + I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with + the seed of man and the seed of beast. 
28And it shall come to pass that + as I have watched over them + to pluck up and break down, to overthrow, destroy, and bring harm, + so I will watch over them + to build and to plant, declares the Lord. 
29In those days they shall no longer say:
30+ But everyone shall die for his own iniquity. Each man who eats sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.
31+ “Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make + a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, 
32not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when + I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, + though I was their husband, declares the Lord. 
33+ For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: + I will put my law within them, and I will write it + on their hearts. + And I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 
34And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ + for they shall all know me, + from the least of them to the greatest, declares the Lord. For + I will forgive their iniquity, and + I will remember their sin no more.”
35Thus says the Lord,
36+ “If this fixed order departs
37Thus says the Lord:
38+ “Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when the city shall be rebuilt for the Lord + from the Tower of Hananel to + the Corner Gate. 
39+ And the measuring line shall go out farther, straight to the hill Gareb, and shall then turn to Goah. 
40+ The whole valley of the dead bodies and the ashes, and all the fields as far as the + brook Kidron, to the corner of + the Horse Gate toward the east, + shall be sacred to the Lord. + It shall not be plucked up or overthrown anymore forever.”
