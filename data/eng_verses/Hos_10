1+ Israel is a luxuriant vine
2Their heart is false;
3For now they will say:
4They utter + mere words;
5The inhabitants of Samaria tremble
6+ The thing itself shall be carried to Assyria
7+ Samariaâ€™s king shall perish
8The high places of + Aven, + the sin of Israel,
9From + the days of Gibeah, you have sinned, O Israel;
10+ When I please, + I will discipline them,
11Ephraim was a trained calf
12+ Sow for yourselves righteousness;
13+ You have plowed iniquity;
14therefore + the tumult of war shall arise among your people,
15Thus it shall be done to you, O + Bethel,
