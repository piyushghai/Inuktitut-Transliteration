1“And now, + O priests, + this command is for you. 
2+ If you will not listen, if you will not take it to heart to give honor to my name, says the Lord of hosts, then I will send + the curse upon you and I will curse + your blessings. Indeed, I have already cursed them, because you do not lay it to heart. 
3Behold, + I will rebuke your offspring,+  and + spread dung on your faces, the + dung of your offerings, and you shall be taken away with it.+ 
4So shall you know that I have sent + this command to you, that + my covenant with Levi may stand, says the Lord of hosts. 
5My covenant with him was one of life and + peace, and I gave them to him. + It was a covenant of fear, and he feared me. He stood in awe of my name. 
6+ True instruction+  was in his mouth, and no wrong was found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he + turned many from iniquity. 
7For + the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and people+  should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts. 
8But you have turned aside from the way. + You have caused many to stumble by your instruction. You have corrupted + the covenant of Levi, says the Lord of hosts, 
9and so + I make you despised and abased before all the people, inasmuch as you do not keep my ways but + show partiality in your instruction.”
10Have we not all + one Father? Has not + one God created us? Why then are we + faithless to one another, profaning the covenant of our fathers? 
11Judah has been + faithless, and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. For + Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the Lord, which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god. 
12May the Lord cut off from the tents of Jacob any descendant+  of the man who does this, who + brings an offering to the Lord of hosts!
13And this second thing you do. + You cover the Lord’s altar with tears, with weeping and groaning because he no longer regards the offering or accepts it with favor from your hand. 
14+ But you say, “Why does he not?” Because the Lord + was witness between you and the wife of your youth, + to whom + you have been faithless, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant. 
15+ Did he not make them one, with a portion of the Spirit in their union?+  And what was the one God+  seeking?+ + Godly offspring. So guard yourselves+  in your spirit, and let none of you be + faithless to the wife of your youth. 
16“For + the man who does not love his wife but divorces her,+  says the Lord, the God of Israel, covers+  his garment with violence, says the Lord of hosts. So guard yourselves in your spirit, and + do not be faithless.”
17+ You have wearied the Lord with your words. + But you say, “How have we wearied him?” + By saying, “Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and he delights in them.” Or by asking, + “Where is the God of justice?”
