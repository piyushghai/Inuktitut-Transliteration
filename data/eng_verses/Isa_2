1The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
2+ It shall come to pass in the latter days
3and + many peoples shall come, and say:
4He shall judge between the nations,
5O house of Jacob,
6For you have rejected your people,
7Their land is + filled with silver and gold,
8Their land is + filled with idols;
9So man + is humbled,
10+ Enter into the rock
11+ The haughty looks of man shall be brought low,
12+ For the Lord of hosts has a day
13against all the + cedars of Lebanon,
14against all + the lofty mountains,
15against every high tower,
16against all + the ships of Tarshish,
17+ And the haughtiness of man shall be humbled,
18+ And the idols shall utterly pass away.
19+ And people shall enter the caves of the rocks
20In that day + mankind will cast away
21+ to enter the caverns of the rocks
22+ Stop regarding man
