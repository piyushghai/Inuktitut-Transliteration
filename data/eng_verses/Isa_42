1+ Behold + my servant, whom I uphold,
2He will not cry aloud or lift up his voice,
3+ a bruised reed he will not break,
4He will not grow faint or be discouraged+ 
5Thus says God, the Lord,
6“I am the Lord; + I have called you+  in righteousness;
7+ to open the eyes that are blind,
8I am the Lord; that is my name;
9Behold, the former things have come to pass,
10+ Sing to the Lord a new song,
11Let the desert and its cities lift up their voice,
12Let them give glory to the Lord,
13+ The Lord goes out like a mighty man,
14For a long time I have held my peace;
15+ I will lay waste mountains and hills,
16+ And I will lead the blind
17+ They are turned back and utterly put to shame,
18Hear, you deaf,
19Who is blind but my servant,
20+ He sees many things, but does not observe them;
21The Lord was pleased, for his righteousness’ sake,
22But this is a people plundered and looted;
23Who among you will give ear to this,
24Who gave up Jacob to the looter,
25So he poured on him the heat of his anger
