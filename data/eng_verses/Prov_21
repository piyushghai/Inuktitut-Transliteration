1The king’s heart is a stream of water in the hand of the Lord;
2+ Every way of a man is right in his own eyes,
3+ To do righteousness and justice
4+ Haughty eyes and a proud heart,
5The plans of + the diligent lead surely to abundance,
6+ The getting of treasures by a lying tongue
7The violence of the wicked will + sweep them away,
8The way of the guilty + is crooked,
9It is + better to live in a corner of the housetop
10The soul of the wicked desires evil;
11When + a scoffer is punished, the simple becomes wise;
12The Righteous One + observes the house of the wicked;
13+ Whoever closes his ear to the cry of the poor
14+ A gift in secret averts anger,
15When justice is done, it is a joy to the righteous
16One who wanders from the way of good sense
17Whoever loves pleasure will be a poor man;
18+ The wicked is a + ransom for the righteous,
19It is + better to live in a desert land
20+ Precious treasure and oil are in a wise man’s dwelling,
21Whoever + pursues righteousness and kindness
22+ A wise man scales the city of the mighty
23+ Whoever keeps his mouth and his tongue
24+ “Scoffer” is the name of the arrogant, haughty man
25The desire of + the sluggard kills him,
26All day long he craves and craves,
27+ The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination;
28+ A false witness will perish,
29A wicked man puts on a bold face,
30+ No wisdom, no understanding, no counsel
31+ The horse is made ready for the day of battle,
