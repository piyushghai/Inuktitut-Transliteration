1The + vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem + in the days of + Uzziah, + Jotham, + Ahaz, and + Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
2+ Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O + earth;
3The ox + knows its owner,
4Ah, sinful nation,
5Why will you still be + struck down?
6+ From the sole of the foot even to the head,
7+ Your country lies desolate;
8And + the daughter of Zion is left
9+ If the Lord of hosts
10Hear the word of the Lord,
11+ “What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices?
12“When you come to + appear before me,
13Bring no more vain offerings;
14Your + new moons and your appointed feasts
15When you + spread out your hands,
16+ Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean;
17learn to do good;
18“Come now, + let us reason+  together, says the Lord:
19+ If you are willing and obedient,
20but if you refuse and rebel,
21How the faithful city
22+ Your silver has become dross,
23Your princes are rebels
24Therefore the + Lord declares,
25+ I will turn my hand against you
26And I will restore your judges + as at the first,
27+ Zion shall be redeemed by justice,
28+ But rebels and sinners shall be broken together,
29+ For they+  shall be ashamed of + the oaks
30For you shall be + like an oak
31And the strong shall become + tinder,
