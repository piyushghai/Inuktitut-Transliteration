1Then + Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:
2“Therefore my + thoughts answer me,
3I hear censure that insults me,
4Do you not know this from of old,
5+ that the exulting of the wicked is short,
6+ Though his height mount up to the heavens,
7he will perish forever like his own + dung;
8He will fly away like + a dream and not be found;
9+ The eye that saw him will see him no more,
10His children will seek the favor of the poor,
11His bones are full of his + youthful vigor,
12“Though evil is sweet in his mouth,
13though he is loath to let it go
14yet his food is turned in his stomach;
15He swallows down riches and vomits them up again;
16He will suck the poison of cobras;
17He will not look upon + the rivers,
18He will + give back the fruit of his toil
19For he has crushed and abandoned the poor;
20“Because he + knew no + contentment in his belly,
21There was nothing left after he had eaten;
22In the fullness of his sufficiency he will be in distress;
23To fill his belly to the full,
24+ He will flee from an iron weapon;
25It + is drawn forth and comes out of his body;
26Utter darkness is laid up for his treasures;
27+ The heavens will reveal his iniquity,
28The possessions of his house will be carried away,
29+ This is the wicked man’s portion from God,
