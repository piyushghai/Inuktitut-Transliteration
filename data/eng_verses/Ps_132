1Remember, O Lord, in David’s favor,
2how he swore to the Lord
3“I will not enter my house
4I will not + give sleep to my eyes
5until I + find a place for the Lord,
6Behold, we heard of it in + Ephrathah;
7“Let us go to his dwelling place;
8+ Arise, O Lord, and go to your + resting place,
9Let your + priests be + clothed with righteousness,
10For the sake of your servant David,
11+ The Lord swore to David a sure oath
12If your sons keep my covenant
13For the Lord has + chosen Zion;
14“This is my + resting place forever;
15I will abundantly + bless her provisions;
16Her + priests I will clothe with salvation,
17There I will make + a horn to sprout for David;
18His enemies I will + clothe with shame,
