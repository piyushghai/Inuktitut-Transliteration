1Oh that you were like a brother to me
2I would lead you and + bring you
3+ His left hand is under my head,
4I + adjure you, O + daughters of Jerusalem,
5+ Who is that coming up from the wilderness,
6Set me as a seal upon your heart,
7Many waters cannot quench love,
8We have a little sister,
9If she is a wall,
10+ I was a wall,
11Solomon had + a vineyard at Baal-hamon;
12My vineyard, my very own, is before me;
13+ O you who dwell in the gardens,
14+ Make haste, my beloved,
