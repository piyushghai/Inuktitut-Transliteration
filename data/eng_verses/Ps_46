1God is our + refuge and strength,
2Therefore we will not fear + though the earth gives way,
3though + its waters roar and foam,
4There is + a river whose streams make glad + the city of God,
5+ God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved;
6+ The nations rage, the kingdoms totter;
7+ The Lord of hosts is with us;
8+ Come, behold the works of the Lord,
9+ He makes wars cease to the end of the earth;
10+ â€œBe still, and know that I am God.
11+ The Lord of hosts is with us;
