1+ The Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 
2“Command the people of Israel to bring you pure oil from beaten olives for the lamp, that a light may be kept burning regularly. 
3Outside the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, Aaron shall arrange it from evening to morning before the Lord regularly. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations. 
4He shall arrange the lamps on the + lampstand of pure gold+  before the Lord regularly.
5“You shall take fine flour and bake twelve + loaves from it; two tenths of an ephah+  shall be in each loaf. 
6And you shall set them in two piles, six in a pile, + on the table of pure gold+  before the Lord. 
7And you shall put pure frankincense on each pile, that it may go with the bread as a memorial portion as a food offering to the Lord. 
8+ Every Sabbath day Aaron shall arrange it before the Lord regularly; it is from the people of Israel as a covenant forever. 
9And + it shall be for Aaron and his sons, and + they shall eat it in a holy place, since it is for him a most holy portion out of the Lord’s food offerings, a perpetual due.”
10Now an Israelite woman’s son, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the people of Israel. And the Israelite woman’s son and a man of Israel fought in the camp, 
11and the Israelite woman’s son + blasphemed the + Name, and cursed. Then they + brought him to Moses. His mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan. 
12And + they put him in custody, + till the will of the Lord should be clear to them.
13Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 
14+ “Bring out of the camp the one who cursed, and let all who heard him + lay their hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him. 
15And speak to the people of Israel, saying, Whoever curses his God shall + bear his sin. 
16Whoever + blasphemes the name of the Lord shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him. The sojourner as well as the native, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death.
17+ “Whoever takes a human life shall surely be put to death. 
18+ Whoever takes an animal’s life shall make it good, life for life. 
19If anyone injures his neighbor, + as he has done it shall be done to him, 
20fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; whatever injury he has given a person shall be given to him. 
21+ Whoever kills an animal shall make it good, + and whoever kills a person shall be put to death. 
22You shall have the + same rule for the sojourner and for the native, for I am the Lord your God.” 
23So Moses spoke to the people of Israel, and + they brought out of the camp the one who had cursed and stoned him with stones. Thus the people of Israel did as the Lord commanded Moses.
