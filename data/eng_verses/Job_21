1Then Job answered and said:
2+ “Keep listening to my words,
3Bear with me, and I will speak,
4As for me, is my + complaint against man?
5Look at me and be appalled,
6When I remember, I am dismayed,
7+ Why do the wicked live,
8Their + offspring are established in their presence,
9Their houses are + safe from fear,
10Their bull breeds without fail;
11They send out their + little boys like a flock,
12They sing to + the tambourine and + the lyre
13They + spend their days in prosperity,
14They say to God, + ‘Depart from us!
15+ What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?
16Behold, is not their prosperity in their hand?
17“How often is it that + the lamp of the wicked is put out?
18That they are like + straw before the wind,
19You say, ‘God + stores up their iniquity for their + children.’
20Let their own eyes see their destruction,
21For what do they care for their houses after them,
22+ Will any teach God knowledge,
23One dies in his full vigor,
24his pails+  full of milk
25Another dies in + bitterness of soul,
26They + lie down alike in the dust,
27“Behold, I know your thoughts
28For you say, + ‘Where is the house of the prince?
29Have you not asked those who travel the roads,
30that + the evil man is spared in the day of calamity,
31Who declares his way + to his face,
32When he is + carried to the grave,
33+ The clods of the valley are sweet to him;
34How then will you comfort me with empty nothings?
