1Lord, you were + favorable to your land;
2You + forgave the iniquity of your people;
3You withdrew all your wrath;
4+ Restore us again, O God of our salvation,
5+ Will you be angry with us forever?
6Will you not + revive us again,
7Show us your steadfast love, O Lord,
8+ Let me hear what God the Lord will speak,
9Surely his + salvation is near to those who fear him,
10+ Steadfast love and faithfulness meet;
11Faithfulness springs up from the ground,
12Yes, + the Lord will give what is good,
13+ Righteousness will go before him
