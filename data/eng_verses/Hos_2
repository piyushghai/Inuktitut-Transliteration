1+  Say to your brothers, + “You are my people,”+  and to your sisters, + “You have received mercy.”+ 
2“Plead with your mother, plead—
3lest + I strip her naked
4+ Upon her children also I will have no mercy,
5For + their mother has played the whore;
6Therefore + I will hedge up her+  way with thorns,
7She shall pursue her lovers
8And + she did not know
9Therefore + I will take back
10Now + I will uncover her lewdness
11+ And I will put an end to all her mirth,
12And + I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees,
13And + I will punish her for + the feast days of the Baals
14“Therefore, behold, I will allure her,
15And there I will give her her vineyards
16“And + in that day, declares the Lord, you will call me ‘My Husband,’ and no longer will you call me ‘My Baal.’ 
17For + I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth, and they shall be remembered by name no more. 
18And + I will make for them a covenant on that day with the beasts of the field, the birds of the heavens, and the creeping things of the ground. And + I will abolish+  the bow, the sword, and war from the land, and I will make you lie down in + safety. 
19And I will betroth you to me + forever. + I will betroth you to me in righteousness and in justice, in steadfast love and in mercy. 
20+ I will betroth you to me in faithfulness. And + you shall know the Lord.
21“And + in that day + I will answer, declares the Lord,
22and the earth shall answer the grain, the wine, and the oil,
23and + I will sow her for myself in the land.
