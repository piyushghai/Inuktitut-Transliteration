1+ Better is a poor person who + walks in his integrity
2Desire+  without knowledge is not good,
3When a man’s folly + brings his way to ruin,
4+ Wealth brings many new friends,
5+ A false witness will not go unpunished,
6Many seek the favor of a generous man,+ 
7+ All a poor man’s brothers hate him;
8+ Whoever gets sense loves his own soul;
9+ A false witness will not go unpunished,
10+ It is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury,
11+ Good sense makes one slow to anger,
12A king’s wrath is like + the growling of a lion,
13+ A foolish son is ruin to his father,
14+ House and wealth are inherited from fathers,
15+ Slothfulness casts into + a deep sleep,
16Whoever + keeps the commandment keeps his life;
17+ Whoever is generous to the poor lends to the Lord,
18+ Discipline your son, for there is hope;
19A man of great wrath will pay the penalty,
20Listen to advice and accept instruction,
21+ Many are the plans in the mind of a man,
22What is desired in a man is steadfast love,
23The fear of the Lord+ leads to life,
24+ The sluggard buries his hand in + the dish
25+ Strike + a scoffer, and the simple will + learn prudence;
26He who does violence to his father and chases away his mother
27Cease to hear instruction, my son,
28A worthless witness mocks at justice,
29Condemnation is ready for + scoffers,
