1+ Better is a dry morsel with quiet
2A servant who deals wisely will rule over + a son who acts shamefully
3+ The crucible is for silver, and the furnace is for gold,
4An evildoer listens to wicked lips,
5Whoever mocks the poor + insults his Maker;
6+ Grandchildren are + the crown of the aged,
7Fine speech is not + becoming to a fool;
8+ A bribe is like a magic stone in the eyes of the one who gives it;
9Whoever + covers an offense seeks love,
10A rebuke goes deeper into a man of understanding
11An evil man seeks only rebellion,
12Let a man meet + a she-bear robbed of her cubs
13If anyone + returns evil for good,
14The beginning of strife is like letting out water,
15He who + justifies the wicked and he who + condemns the righteous
16Why should a fool have money in his hand + to buy wisdom
17+ A friend loves at all times,
18One who lacks sense gives a pledge
19Whoever loves transgression loves strife;
20+ A man of crooked heart does not discover good,
21He who + sires a fool gets himself sorrow,
22+ A joyful heart is good medicine,
23The wicked accepts + a bribe in secret+ 
24+ The discerning sets his face toward wisdom,
25+ A foolish son is a grief to his father
26+ To impose a fine on a righteous man is not good,
27Whoever + restrains his words has knowledge,
28Even a fool + who keeps silent is considered wise;
