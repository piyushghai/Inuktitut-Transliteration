1Save me, O God!
2I sink in deep + mire,
3+ I am weary with my crying out;
4+ More in number than the hairs of my head
5O God, you know my folly;
6Let not those who hope in you + be put to shame through me,
7For it is + for your sake that I have borne reproach,
8I have become + a stranger to my brothers,
9For + zeal for your house has consumed me,
10When I wept and humbled+  my soul with fasting,
11When I made + sackcloth my clothing,
12I am the talk of those who + sit in the gate,
13But as for me, my + prayer is to you, O Lord.
14Deliver me
15Let not the flood sweep over me,
16Answer me, O Lord, for your + steadfast love is good;
17+ Hide not your face from your servant;
18Draw near to my soul, redeem me;
19You know my + reproach,
20+ Reproaches have broken my heart,
21They gave me + poison for food,
22+ Let their own + table before them become a snare;
23+ Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see,
24Pour out your indignation upon them,
25+ May their camp be a desolation;
26For they + persecute him whom + you have struck down,
27+ Add to them punishment upon punishment;
28Let them be + blotted out of the book of the living;
29But I am afflicted and in pain;
30I will + praise the name of God with a song;
31This will + please the Lord more than an ox
32When + the humble see it they will be glad;
33For the Lord hears the needy
34Let + heaven and earth praise him,
35For + God will save Zion
36+ the offspring of his servants shall inherit it,
