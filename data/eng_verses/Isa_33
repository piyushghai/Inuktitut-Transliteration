1+ Ah, you destroyer,
2O Lord, be gracious to us; + we wait for you.
3+ At the tumultuous noise peoples flee;
4and your spoil is gathered as the caterpillar gathers;
5+ The Lord is exalted, for he dwells on high;
6+ and he will be the stability of your times,
7Behold, their heroes cry in the streets;
8+ The highways lie waste;
9+ The land mourns and languishes;
10+ “Now I will arise,” says the Lord,
11+ You conceive chaff; you give birth to stubble;
12And the peoples will be as if burned to lime,
13Hear, you who are far off, what I have done;
14The sinners in Zion are afraid;
15+ He who walks righteously and speaks uprightly,
16he will dwell on the heights;
17+ Your eyes will behold the king in his beauty;
18+ Your heart will muse on the terror:
19+ You will see no more the insolent people,
20Behold Zion, the city of our appointed feasts!
21But there the Lord in majesty will be for us
22For the Lord is our + judge; the Lord is our + lawgiver;
23Your cords hang loose;
24And no inhabitant will say, + “I am sick”;
