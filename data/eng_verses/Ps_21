1O Lord, in your + strength the king rejoices,
2You have + given him his heartâ€™s desire
3For you + meet him with rich blessings;
4He asked life of you; you + gave it to him,
5His + glory is great through your salvation;
6For you make him most blessed forever;+ 
7For the king trusts in the Lord,
8Your hand will + find out all your enemies;
9You will make them as + a blazing oven
10You + will destroy their + descendants from the earth,
11Though they plan evil against you,
12For you will put them + to flight;
13Be exalted, O Lord, in your strength!
