1Who is this who comes from + Edom,
2Why is your + apparel red,
3+ “I have trodden the winepress alone,
4+ For the day of vengeance was in my heart,
5I looked, but + there was no one to help;
6I trampled down the peoples in my anger;
7I will recount the steadfast love of the Lord,
8For he said, “Surely they are my people,
9+ In all their affliction he was afflicted,+ 
10+ But they rebelled
11Then he remembered + the days of old,
12who caused his glorious arm
13who led them through the depths?
14Like livestock that go down into the valley,
15+ Look down from heaven and see,
16For + you are our Father,
17O Lord, why do you make us wander from your ways
18+ Your holy people held possession for a little while;+ 
19+ We have become like those over whom you have never ruled,
