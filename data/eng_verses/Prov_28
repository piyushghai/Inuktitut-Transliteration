1+ The wicked flee when no one pursues,
2When a land transgresses, + it has many rulers,
3+ A poor man who oppresses the poor
4Those who forsake the law + praise the wicked,
5Evil men + do not understand justice,
6+ Better is a poor man who + walks in his integrity
7The one who keeps the law is a son with understanding,
8Whoever multiplies his wealth + by interest and profit+ 
9If one turns away his ear from hearing the law,
10Whoever misleads the upright into an evil way
11A rich man is wise in his + own eyes,
12When + the righteous triumph, there is great glory,
13Whoever + conceals his transgressions will not prosper,
14Blessed is the one who + fears the Lord always,
15Like + a roaring lion or + a charging bear
16A ruler who + lacks understanding is a cruel oppressor,
17If one is burdened with + the blood of another,
18+ Whoever + walks in integrity will be delivered,
19+ Whoever works his land will have plenty of bread,
20A faithful man will abound with blessings,
21To show + partiality is not good,
22A + stingy man+ + hastens after wealth
23Whoever + rebukes a man will afterward find more favor
24Whoever robs his father or his mother
25A greedy man + stirs up strife,
26Whoever + trusts in his own mind is a fool,
27Whoever + gives to the poor will not want,
28When + the wicked rise, + people hide themselves,
