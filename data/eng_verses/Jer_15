1Then the Lord said to me, + “Though + Moses + and Samuel + stood before me, yet my heart would not turn toward this people. Send them out of my sight, and let them go! 
2And when they ask you, ‘Where shall we go?’ you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord:
3+ I will appoint over them four kinds of destroyers, declares the Lord: the sword to kill, the dogs to tear, and + the birds of the air + and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy. 
4+ And I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth because of what + Manasseh the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem.
5+ “Who will have pity on you, O Jerusalem,
6+ You have rejected me, declares the Lord;
7+ I have winnowed them with + a winnowing fork
8I have made their widows more in number
9+ She who bore seven has grown feeble;
10+ Woe is me, my mother, that you bore me, a man of strife and contention to the whole land! + I have not lent, nor have I borrowed, yet all of them curse me.

12Can one break iron, iron + from the north, and bronze?
13+ “Your wealth and your treasures I will give as + spoil, without price, for all your sins, throughout all your territory. 
14I will make you serve your enemies + in a land that you do not know, + for in my anger a fire is kindled that shall burn forever.”
15+ O Lord, you know;
16Your words were found, + and I ate them,
17+ I did not sit in the company of revelers,
18Why is my pain unceasing,
19Therefore thus says the Lord:
20+ And I will make you to this people
21+ I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked,
