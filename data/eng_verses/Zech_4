1And + the angel who talked with me came again + and woke me, like a man who is awakened out of his sleep. 
2And he said to me, “What do you see?” I said, “I see, and behold, + a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and + seven lamps on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps that are on the top of it. 
3And there are + two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.” 
4And I said to + the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?” 
5Then the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, + “Do you not know what these are?” I said, “No, my lord.” 
6Then he said to me, “This is the word of the Lord to + Zerubbabel: + Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the Lord of hosts. 
7Who are you, + O great mountain? Before + Zerubbabel + you shall become a plain. And he shall bring forward + the top stone amid shouts of ‘Grace, grace to it!’”
8Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 
9+ “The hands of + Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also + complete it. + Then you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me to you. 
10+ For whoever has despised the day of small things shall rejoice, and shall see + the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel.
11Then I said to him, “What are these + two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?” 
12And a second time I answered and said to him, “What are these + two branches of the olive trees, which are beside the two golden pipes from which the golden oil+  is poured out?” 
13He said to me, + “Do you not know what these are?” I said, “No, my lord.” 
14Then he said, + “These are the two anointed ones+  who stand by + the Lord of the whole earth.”
