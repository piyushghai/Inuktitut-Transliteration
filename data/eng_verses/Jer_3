1+ “If+  a man divorces his wife
2Lift up your eyes to + the bare heights, and see!
3+ Therefore the showers have been withheld,
4Have you not just now + called to me,
5+ will he be angry forever,
6The Lord said to me in the days of + King Josiah: “Have you seen what she did, that faithless one, Israel, + how she went up on every high hill and under every green tree, and there + played the whore? 
7And I thought, ‘After she has done all this she will return to me,’ but she did not return, and her treacherous + sister Judah saw it. 
8She saw that for all the adulteries of that faithless one, Israel, + I had sent her away with + a decree of divorce. + Yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear, but she too went + and played the whore. 
9Because she took her whoredom lightly, she polluted the land, committing adultery with + stone and tree. 
10Yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to me + with her whole heart, but in pretense, declares the Lord.”
11And the Lord said to me, + “Faithless Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah. 
12Go, and proclaim these words toward + the north, and say,
13+ Only acknowledge your guilt,
14+ Return, O faithless children,
15“‘And + I will give you shepherds after my own heart, + who will feed you with knowledge and understanding. 
16And when you have multiplied and been fruitful in the land, in those days, declares the Lord, they shall no more say, “The ark of the covenant of the Lord.” It shall not come to mind or be remembered or missed; it shall not be made again. 
17At that time Jerusalem shall be called the throne of the Lord, + and all nations shall gather to it, + to the presence of the Lord in Jerusalem, and they shall no more stubbornly follow their own evil heart. 
18+ In those days the house of Judah shall join the house of Israel, and together they shall come from the land + of the north to + the land that I gave your fathers for a heritage.
19“‘I said,
20+ Surely, as a treacherous wife leaves her husband,
21A voice on the + bare heights is heard,
22+ “Return, O faithless sons;
23Truly + the hills are a delusion,
24“But from our youth the shameful thing has devoured all for which our fathers labored, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. 
25+ Let us lie down in our shame, and let our dishonor cover us. For + we have sinned against the Lord our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and we have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God.”
