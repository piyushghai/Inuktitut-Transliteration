1+ Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised
2+ beautiful in elevation,
3Within her citadels God
4For behold, + the kings assembled;
5As soon as they saw it, they were astounded;
6+ Trembling took hold of them there,
7By + the east wind you + shattered
8As we have heard, so have we seen
9We have thought on your + steadfast love, O God,
10As your + name, O God,
11Let Mount + Zion be glad!
12Walk about Zion, go around her,
13consider well her + ramparts,
14that this is God,
