1Ah, Ariel, Ariel,
2Yet I will distress Ariel,
3+ And I will encamp against you all around,
4+ And you will be brought low; from the earth you shall speak,
5But the multitude of your foreign foes shall be like + small dust,
6+ you will be visited by the Lord of hosts
7And + the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel,
8+ As when a hungry man dreams, and behold, he is eating
9Astonish yourselves+  and be astonished;
10+ For the Lord has poured out upon you
11And the vision of all this has become to you like the words of a book that is + sealed. When men give it to one who can read, saying, “Read this,” he says, “I cannot, for it is sealed.” 
12And when they give the book to one who cannot read, saying, “Read this,” he says, “I cannot read.”
13And the Lord said:
14therefore, behold, + I will again
15Ah, + you who hide deep from the Lord your counsel,
16+ You turn things upside down!
17Is it not yet a very little while
18In that day + the deaf shall hear
19+ The meek shall obtain fresh joy in the Lord,
20For the ruthless shall come to nothing
21who by a word make a man out to be an offender,
22Therefore thus says the Lord, + who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob:
23For when he sees his children,
24And those + who go astray in spirit will come to understanding,
