1+  “Can you draw out + Leviathan+  with a fishhook
2Can you put + a rope in his nose
3Will he make many pleas to you?
4Will he make a covenant with you
5Will you play with him as with a bird,
6Will traders bargain over him?
7Can you fill his skin with harpoons
8Lay your hands on him;
9+  Behold, the hope of a man is false;
10No one is so fierce that he dares to stir him up.
11+ Who has first given to me, that I should repay him?
12“I will not keep silence concerning his limbs,
13Who can strip off his outer garment?
14Who can open the doors of his face?
15His back is made of+  rows of shields,
16One is so near to another
17They are + joined one to another;
18His sneezings flash forth light,
19Out of his mouth go flaming torches;
20Out of his nostrils comes forth smoke,
21His breath + kindles coals,
22In his neck abides strength,
23The folds of his flesh + stick together,
24His heart is hard as a stone,
25When he raises himself up the mighty+  are afraid;
26Though the sword reaches him, it does not avail,
27He counts iron as straw,
28The arrow cannot make him flee;
29Clubs are counted as stubble;
30His underparts are like sharp + potsherds;
31He makes the deep boil like a pot;
32Behind him he leaves a shining wake;
33+ On earth there is not his like,
34He sees everything that is high;
