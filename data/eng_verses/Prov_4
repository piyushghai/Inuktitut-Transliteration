1+ Hear, O sons, a fatherâ€™s instruction,
2for I give you good + precepts;
3When I was a son with my father,
4he + taught me and said to me,
5+ Get wisdom; get + insight;
6Do not forsake her, and she will keep you;
7+ The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom,
8Prize her highly, and she will exalt you;
9She will place on your head + a graceful garland;
10+ Hear, + my son, and accept my words,
11I have + taught you the way of wisdom;
12When you walk, + your step will not be hampered,
13+ Keep hold of instruction; do not let go;
14+ Do not enter the path of the wicked,
15Avoid it; do not go on it;
16For they + cannot sleep unless they have done wrong;
17For they eat the bread of wickedness
18But + the path of the righteous is like + the light of dawn,
19+ The way of the wicked is like deep + darkness;
20+ My son, be attentive to my words;
21+ Let them not escape from your sight;
22For they are + life to those who find them,
23Keep your heart with all vigilance,
24Put away from you + crooked speech,
25+ Let your eyes look directly forward,
26+ Ponder+  the path of your feet;
27+ Do not swerve to the right or to the left;
