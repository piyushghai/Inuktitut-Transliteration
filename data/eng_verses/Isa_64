1+ Oh that you would rend the heavens and come down,
2+  as when fire kindles brushwood
3+ When you did awesome things that we did not look for,
4+ From of old no one has heard
5You meet him who joyfully works righteousness,
6+ We have all become like one who is unclean,
7+ There is no one who calls upon your name,
8+ But now, O Lord, you are our Father;
9+ Be not so terribly angry, O Lord,
10+ Your holy cities have become a wilderness;
11+ Our holy and beautiful+  house,
12+ Will you restrain yourself at these things, O Lord?
