1+ Give ear to my prayer, O God,
2Attend to me, and answer me;
3because of the noise of the enemy,
4My heart is in anguish within me;
5Fear and trembling come upon me,
6And I say, “Oh, that I had wings like a dove!
7+ yes, I would wander far away;
8I would hurry to find a shelter
9Destroy, O Lord, + divide their tongues;
10Day and night they go around it
11ruin is in its midst;
12For it is not an enemy who taunts me—
13+ But it is you, a man, my equal,
14We used to take sweet counsel together;
15Let death steal over them;
16But I call to God,
17+ Evening and + morning and at + noon
18He redeems my soul in safety
19God will give ear and humble them,
20My companion+ + stretched out his hand against his friends;
21His + speech was + smooth as butter,
22+ Cast your burden on the Lord,
23But you, O God, + will cast them down
