1+ Arise, shine, for your light has come,
2For behold, darkness shall cover the earth,
3+ And nations shall come to your light,
4+ Lift up your eyes all around, and see;
5Then you shall see and + be radiant;
6A multitude of camels shall cover you,
7All the flocks of + Kedar shall be gathered to you;
8Who are these that fly like a cloud,
9For + the coastlands shall hope for me,
10+ Foreigners shall build up your walls,
11+ Your gates shall be open continually;
12+ For the nation and kingdom
13+ The glory of Lebanon shall come to you,
14+ The sons of those who afflicted you
15+ Whereas you have been forsaken and hated,
16+ You shall suck the milk of nations;
17Instead of bronze I will bring gold,
18+ Violence shall no more be heard in your land,
19+ The sun shall be no more
20Your sun shall no more go down,
21+ Your people shall all be righteous;
22+ The least one shall become a clan,
