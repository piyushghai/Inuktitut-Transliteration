1Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
2“If one ventures a word with you, will you be impatient?
3Behold, you have instructed many,
4Your words have upheld him who was stumbling,
5But now it has come to you, and you are impatient;
6+ Is not your fear of God+  your + confidence,
7“Remember: + who that was innocent ever perished?
8As I have seen, those who + plow iniquity
9By + the breath of God they perish,
10The roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion,
11The strong lion perishes for lack of prey,
12“Now a word was brought to me stealthily;
13Amid + thoughts from + visions of the night,
14dread came upon me, and trembling,
15A spirit glided past my face;
16It stood still,
17+ ‘Can mortal man be in the right before+  God?
18Even in his servants + he puts no trust,
19how much more those who dwell in houses of + clay,
20Between + morning and evening they are beaten to pieces;
21Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them,
