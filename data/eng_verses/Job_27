1And Job again + took up his discourse, and said:
2“As God lives, who has + taken away my right,
3as long as my breath is in me,
4my lips will not speak + falsehood,
5Far be it from me to say that you are right;
6I + hold fast my righteousness and will not let it go;
7“Let my enemy be as the wicked,
8+ For what is the hope of the godless + when God cuts him off,
9+ Will God hear his cry
10Will he + take delight in the Almighty?
11I will teach you concerning the hand of God;
12Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves;
13+ “This is the portion of a wicked man with God,
14If his + children are multiplied, it is for + the sword,
15Those who survive him the pestilence buries,
16Though he + heap up silver like dust,
17he may pile it up, but the righteous will wear it,
18He builds his + house like a moth’s,
19He goes to bed rich, but will + do so no more;
20+ Terrors overtake him like + a flood;
21+ The east wind lifts him up and he is gone;
22It+  hurls at him + without pity;
23It + claps its hands at him
