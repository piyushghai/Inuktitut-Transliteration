1Thus says the Lord to me, “Go and buy a linen loincloth and + put it around your waist, and do not dip it in water.” 
2So I bought a loincloth according to the word of the Lord, and put it around my waist. 
3And the word of the Lord came to me a second time, 
4“Take the loincloth that you have bought, which is around your waist, and arise, + go to the Euphrates and hide it there in + a cleft of the rock.” 
5So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the Lord commanded me. 
6And after many days the Lord said to me, “Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take from there + the loincloth that I commanded you to hide there.” 
7Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and I took + the loincloth from the place where I had hidden it. And behold, the loincloth was + spoiled; it was + good for nothing.
8Then the word of the Lord came to me: 
9“Thus says the Lord: + Even so will I spoil the pride of Judah and the great + pride of Jerusalem. 
10This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, + who stubbornly follow their own heart and have gone after other gods to serve them and worship them, shall be like this loincloth, which is + good for nothing. 
11For as the loincloth clings to the waist of a man, so I made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me, declares the Lord, + that they might be for me a people, + a name, a praise, and a glory, but they would not listen.
12“You shall speak to them this word: ‘Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, “Every jar shall be filled with wine.”’ And they will say to you, ‘Do we not indeed know that + every jar will be filled with wine?’ 
13Then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord: + Behold, I will fill with drunkenness all the inhabitants of this land: + the kings who sit on David’s throne, + the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
14And I will + dash them one against another, fathers and sons together, declares the Lord. I will not pity or spare or have compassion, that I should not destroy them.’”
15Hear and give ear; be not proud,
16+ Give glory to the Lord your God
17But if you will not listen,
18Say to + the king and + the queen mother:
19+ The cities of the Negeb are shut up,
20“Lift up your eyes + and see
21What will you say when they set as head over you
22And if you say in your heart,
23+ Can the Ethiopian change his skin
24I will scatter you+ + like chaff
25+ This is your lot,
26+ I myself will lift up your skirts over your face,
27I have seen + your abominations,
