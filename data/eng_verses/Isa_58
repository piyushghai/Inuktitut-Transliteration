1“Cry aloud; do not hold back;
2+ Yet they seek me daily
3+ ‘Why have we fasted, and you see it not?
4Behold, you fast only to quarrel and to fight
5+ Is such the fast that I choose,
6“Is not this the fast that I choose:
7Is it not + to share your bread with the hungry
8+ Then shall your light break forth like the dawn,
9Then you shall call, and the Lord will answer;
10+ if you pour yourself out for the hungry
11And the Lord will guide you continually
12+ And your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt;
13+ “If you turn back your foot from the Sabbath,
14then you shall take delight in the Lord,
