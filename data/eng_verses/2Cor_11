1I wish you would bear with me in a little foolishness. Do bear with me! 
2For I feel a divine jealousy for you, since + I betrothed you to one husband, + to present you + as a pure virgin to Christ. 
3But I am afraid that + as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts + will be led astray from a + sincere and + pure devotion to Christ. 
4For if someone comes and + proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or if you accept + a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it readily enough. 
5Indeed, I consider that + I am not in the least inferior to these super-apostles. 
6+ Even if I am unskilled in speaking, + I am not so in knowledge; indeed, in every way + we have made this plain to you in all things.
7Or + did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because + I preached God’s gospel to you free of charge? 
8I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you. 
9And when I was with you and was + in need, + I did not burden anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia + supplied my need. So I refrained and will refrain + from burdening you in any way. 
10+ As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine + will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia. 
11And why? + Because I do not love you? + God knows I do!
12And what I am doing I will continue to do, + in order to undermine the claim of those who would like to claim that in their boasted mission they work on the same terms as we do. 
13For such men are + false apostles, + deceitful workmen, + disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. 
14And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as + an angel of light. 
15So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as + servants of righteousness. + Their end will correspond to their deeds.
16I repeat, + let no one think me foolish. But even if you do, accept me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little. 
17What I am saying + with this boastful confidence, + I say not as the Lord would+  but as a fool. 
18Since + many boast according to the flesh, I too will boast. 
19For you gladly bear with fools, + being wise yourselves! 
20For you bear it if someone + makes slaves of you, or + devours you, or takes advantage of you, or puts on airs, or + strikes you in the face. 
21To my shame, I must say, + we were too weak for that!
22Are they Hebrews? + So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they offspring of Abraham? So am I. 
23Are they + servants of Christ? + I am a better one—I am talking like a madman—with far greater labors, + far more imprisonments, + with countless beatings, and + often near death. 
24Five times I received at the hands of the Jews the + forty lashes less one. 
25Three times I was + beaten with rods. + Once I was stoned. Three times I + was shipwrecked; a night and a day I was adrift at sea; 
26on frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, + danger from my own people, + danger from Gentiles, + danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger from false brothers; 
27+ in toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, + in hunger and thirst, often without food,+  in cold and exposure. 
28And, apart from other things, there is the daily pressure on me of my anxiety for + all the churches. 
29+ Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to fall, and I am not indignant?
30+ If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness. 
31+ The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, + he who is blessed forever, + knows that I am not lying. 
32At Damascus, the governor under King Aretas + was guarding the city of Damascus in order to seize me, 
33+ but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his hands.
