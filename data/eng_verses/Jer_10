1Hear the word that the Lord speaks to you, O house of Israel. 
2Thus says the Lord:
3+ for the customs of the peoples are vanity.+ 
4+ They decorate it with silver and gold;
5Their idols+  are like scarecrows in a cucumber field,
6+ There is none like you, O Lord;
7+ Who would not fear you, O King of the nations?
8+ They are both + stupid and foolish;
9+ Beaten silver is brought from + Tarshish,
10+ But the Lord is the true God;
11Thus shall you say to them: + “The gods who did not make the heavens and the earth + shall perish from the earth and from under the heavens.”+ 
12+ It is he who + made the earth by his power,
13+ When he utters his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens,
14+ Every man is stupid and without knowledge;
15They are worthless, a work of delusion;
16Not like these is he who is + the portion of Jacob,
17+ Gather up your bundle from the ground,
18For thus says the Lord:
19Woe is me because of my hurt!
20+ My tent is destroyed,
21+ For the shepherds + are stupid
22A voice, a rumor! Behold, it comes!—
23+ I know, O Lord, that the way of man is not in himself,
24+ Correct me, O Lord, but in justice;
25+ Pour out your wrath on the nations that know you not,
