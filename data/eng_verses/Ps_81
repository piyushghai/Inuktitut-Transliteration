1+ Sing aloud to God our strength;
2Raise a song; sound + the tambourine,
3Blow the trumpet at + the new moon,
4For it is a statute for Israel,
5He made it + a decree in + Joseph
6“I + relieved your+  shoulder of + the burden;
7In distress you + called, and I delivered you;
8+ Hear, O my people, while I admonish you!
9There shall be no + strange god among you;
10+ I am the Lord your God,
11“But my people did not listen to my voice;
12So I + gave them over to their + stubborn hearts,
13+ Oh, that my people would listen to me,
14I would soon subdue their enemies
15Those who hate the Lord would + cringe toward him,
16But he would feed you+  with + the finest of the wheat,
