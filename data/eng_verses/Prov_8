1Does not + wisdom call?
2On + the heights beside the way,
3beside + the gates in front of + the town,
4“To you, O + men, I call,
5O + simple ones, learn + prudence;
6Hear, for I will speak + noble things,
7for my + mouth will utter truth;
8All the words of my mouth are righteous;
9They are all + straight to him who understands,
10+ Take my instruction instead of silver,
11+ for wisdom is better than jewels,
12“I, wisdom, dwell with prudence,
13+ The fear of the Lord is + hatred of evil.
14I have + counsel and + sound wisdom;
15By me + kings reign,
16by me princes rule,
17+ I love those who love me,
18+ Riches and honor are with me,
19My fruit is + better than + gold, even fine gold,
20I walk in the way of righteousness,
21granting an inheritance to those who love me,
22+ “The Lord + possessed+  me at the beginning of his work,+ 
23Ages ago I was + set up,
24When there were no + depths I was + brought forth,
25Before the mountains + had been shaped,
26before he had made the earth with its fields,
27When he + established the heavens, I was there;
28when he + made firm the skies above,
29when he + assigned to the sea its + limit,
30then + I was beside him, like a master workman,
31+ rejoicing in his + inhabited world
32“And now, + O sons, listen to me:
33+ Hear instruction and be wise,
34+ Blessed is the one who listens to me,
35For + whoever finds me + finds life
36but he who fails to find me + injures himself;
