1Listen to me, + O coastlands,
2+ He made my mouth like a sharp sword;
3And he said to me, “You are my servant,
4+ But I said, “I have labored in vain;
5+ And now the Lord says,
6he says:
7Thus says the Lord,
8Thus says the Lord:
9+ saying to the prisoners, ‘Come out,’
10+ they shall not hunger or thirst,
11+ And I will make all my mountains a road,
12+ Behold, these shall come from afar,
13+ Sing for joy, O heavens, and exult, O earth;
14But Zion said, + “The Lord has forsaken me;
15+ “Can a woman forget her nursing child,
16Behold, + I have engraved you on the palms of my hands;
17Your builders make haste;+ 
18+ Lift up your eyes around and see;
19“Surely your waste and your desolate places
20+ The children of your bereavement
21Then you will say in your heart:
22Thus says the Lord God:
23+ Kings shall be your foster fathers,
24Can the prey be taken from the mighty,
25For thus says the Lord:
26+ I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh,
