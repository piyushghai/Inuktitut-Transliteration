1O God, why do you + cast us off forever?
2+ Remember your congregation, which you have + purchased of old,
3Direct your steps to + the perpetual ruins;
4Your foes have + roared in the midst of your meeting place;
5They were like those who swing + axes
6And all its + carved wood
7They + set your sanctuary on fire;
8They + said to themselves, “We will utterly subdue them”;
9We do not see our + signs;
10How long, O God, + is the foe to scoff?
11Why + do you hold back your hand, your right hand?
12Yet + God my King is from of old,
13You + divided the sea by your might;
14You crushed the heads of + Leviathan;
15You + split open springs and brooks;
16Yours is the day, yours also the night;
17You have + fixed all the boundaries of the earth;
18+ Remember this, O Lord, how the enemy scoffs,
19Do not deliver the soul of your + dove to the wild beasts;
20Have regard for + the covenant,
21Let not + the downtrodden + turn back in shame;
22Arise, O God, + defend your cause;
23Do not forget the clamor of your foes,
