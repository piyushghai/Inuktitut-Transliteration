1Blessed be the Lord, my + rock,
2he is my + steadfast love and my + fortress,
3O Lord, + what is man that you + regard him,
4+ Man is like a breath;
5+ Bow your heavens, O Lord, and come down!
6+ Flash forth the lightning and scatter them;
7+ Stretch out your hand from on high;
8whose mouths speak + lies
9I will sing + a new song to you, O God;
10who gives victory to kings,
11Rescue me and deliver me
12May our sons in their youth
13+ may our granaries be full,
14may our cattle be heavy with young,
15+ Blessed are the people to whom such blessings fall!
