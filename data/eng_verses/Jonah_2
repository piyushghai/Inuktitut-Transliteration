1Then Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the belly of the fish, 
2saying,
3+ For you cast me into the deep,
4+ Then I said, â€˜I am driven away
5+ The waters closed in over me + to take my life;
6at the roots of the mountains.
7When my life was fainting away,
8+ Those who pay regard to vain idols
9+ But I with the voice of thanksgiving
10And the Lord spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out upon the dry land.
