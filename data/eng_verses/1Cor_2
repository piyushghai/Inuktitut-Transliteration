1And I, when I came to you, brothers,+ + did not come proclaiming to you + the testimony+  of God with lofty speech or wisdom. 
2For I decided to know nothing among you except + Jesus Christ and him crucified. 
3And + I was with you + in weakness and in fear and much trembling, 
4and my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of + the Spirit and of power, 
5so that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men+  but + in the power of God.
6Yet among + the mature we do impart wisdom, although it is not + a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, + who are doomed to pass away. 
7But we impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God, + which God decreed before the ages for our glory. 
8None of + the rulers of this age understood this, for + if they had, they would not have crucified + the Lord of glory. 
9But, as it is written,
10these things + God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even + the depths of God. 
11For who knows a person’s thoughts + except the spirit of that person, which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. 
12Now + we have received not + the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God. 
13And we impart this + in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, + interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual.+ 
14The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are + folly to him, and + he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned. 
15The + spiritual person judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one. 
16+ “For who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?” But + we have the mind of Christ.
