1I saw the Lord standing beside+  the altar, and he said:
2+ “If they dig into Sheol,
3If they hide themselves on + the top of Carmel,
4+ And if they go into captivity before their enemies,
5The Lord God of hosts,
6+ who builds his upper chambers in the heavens
7“Are you not like + the Cushites to me,
8Behold, + the eyes of the Lord God are upon the sinful kingdom,
9“For behold, I will command,
10All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword,
11“In that day + I will raise up
12+ that they may possess the remnant of Edom
13“Behold, the days are coming,” declares the Lord,
14+ I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel,
15+ I will plant them on their land,
