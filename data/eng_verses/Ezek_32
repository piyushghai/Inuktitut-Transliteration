1+ In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me: 
2+ “Son of man, + raise a lamentation over + Pharaoh king of Egypt and say to him:
3Thus says the Lord God:
4And + I will cast you on the ground;
5I will strew your flesh + upon the mountains
6I will drench the land even to the mountains
7+ When I blot you out, + I will cover the heavens
8All the bright lights of heaven
9“I will trouble the hearts of many peoples, when I bring your destruction among the nations, into the countries that you have not known. 
10+ I will make many peoples appalled at you, and the hair of their kings shall bristle with horror because of you, when + I brandish my sword before them. + They shall tremble every moment, every one for his own life, on the day of your downfall.
11“For thus says the Lord God: + The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon you. 
12I will cause + your multitude to fall by the swords of mighty ones, all of them + most ruthless of nations.
13I will destroy all its beasts
14Then + I will make their waters clear,
15When I make the land of Egypt desolate,
16+ This is a lamentation that shall be chanted; the daughters of the nations shall chant it; over Egypt, and over + all her multitude, shall they chant it, declares the Lord God.”
17+ In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month,+  on the fifteenth day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me: 
18+ “Son of man, + wail over + the multitude of Egypt, and + send them down, her and the daughters of majestic nations, + to the world below, to those who have gone down to the pit:
19+ ‘Whom do you surpass in beauty?
20They shall fall amid those + who are slain by the sword. Egypt+  is delivered to the sword; drag her away, and + all her multitudes. 
21The mighty chiefs + shall speak of them, + with their helpers, out of the midst of Sheol: ‘They have come down, they lie still, + the uncircumcised, + slain by the sword.’
22+ “Assyria is there, and all her company, + its graves all around it, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, 
23whose graves are set in + the uttermost parts of the pit; and her company is all around her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, + who spread terror + in the land of the living.
24+ “Elam is + there, and all her multitude around her grave; all of them + slain, fallen by the sword, who went down uncircumcised into + the world below, who spread their terror in the land of the living; and + they bear their shame + with those who go down to the pit. 
25+ They have made her a bed among the slain with all her multitude, + her graves all around it, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for terror of them was spread in the land of the living, and they bear their shame with those who go down to the pit; they are placed among the slain.
26+ “Meshech-Tubal is + there, and all her multitude, + her graves all around it, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for they spread their terror in the land of the living. 
27And + they do not lie with the mighty, the fallen from among the uncircumcised, who went down to Sheol with their weapons of war, whose swords were laid under their heads, and whose iniquities are upon their bones; for the terror of the mighty men was in the land of the living. 
28But as for you, you shall be broken + and lie among the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword.
29+ “Edom is + there, her kings and all her princes, who for all their might are laid with those who are killed by the sword; they lie with the uncircumcised, with those who go down to the pit.
30“The princes + of the north are there, all of them, and all the + Sidonians, who have gone down in shame with the slain, + for all the terror that they caused by their might; they lie uncircumcised with those who are slain by the sword, and + bear their shame with those who go down to the pit.
31“When Pharaoh sees them, he + will be comforted for + all his multitude, Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword, declares the Lord God. 
32+ For I spread terror + in the land of the living; and he shall be laid to rest among + the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword, Pharaoh and all his multitude, declares the Lord God.”
