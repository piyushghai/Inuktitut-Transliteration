1Now + Pashhur the priest, the son of + Immer, who was + chief officer in the house of the Lord, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things. 
2Then + Pashhur beat Jeremiah the prophet, and put him + in the stocks that were in the upper + Benjamin Gate of the house of the Lord. 
3The next day, when + Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, “The Lord does not call your name + Pashhur, but Terror on Every Side. 
4For thus says the Lord: Behold, I will make you + a terror to yourself and to all your friends. They shall fall by the sword of their enemies while you look on. And I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon. He shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall strike them down with the sword. 
5Moreover, + I will give all the wealth of the city, all its gains, all its + prized belongings, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hand of their enemies, who shall plunder them and seize them and carry them to Babylon. 
6And you, + Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house, shall go into captivity. To Babylon you shall go, and there you shall die, and there you shall be buried, you and all your friends, + to whom you have prophesied falsely.”
7O Lord, + you have deceived me,
8For whenever I speak, I cry out,
9If I say, “I will not mention him,
10+ For I hear many whispering.
11But + the Lord is with me as a dread warrior;
12O Lord of hosts, who tests the righteous,
13+ Sing to the Lord;
14+ Cursed be the day
15Cursed be the man who brought the news to my father,
16Let that man be like + the cities
17+ because he did not kill me in the womb;
18+ Why did I come out from the womb
