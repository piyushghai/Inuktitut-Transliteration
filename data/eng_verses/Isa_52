1+ Awake, awake,
2+ Shake yourself from the dust and arise;
3For thus says the Lord: + “You were sold for nothing, and + you shall be redeemed without money.” 
4For thus says the Lord God: + “My people went down at the first into Egypt to sojourn there, and the Assyrian oppressed them for nothing.+ 
5Now therefore what have I here,” declares the Lord, “seeing that my people are taken away for nothing? Their rulers wail,” declares the Lord, “and + continually all the day my name is despised. 
6Therefore my people shall know my name. + Therefore in that day they shall know that it is I who speak; here I am.”
7+ How beautiful upon the mountains
8The voice of + your watchmen—they lift up their voice;
9+ Break forth together into singing,
10+ The Lord has bared his holy arm
11+ Depart, depart, go out from there;
12For you shall not + go out in haste,
13Behold, + my servant shall act wisely;+ 
14As many were astonished at you—
15so + shall he sprinkle+  many nations;
