1And Elihu answered and said:
2“Do you think this to be just?
3that you ask, + ‘What advantage have I?
4I will answer you
5+ Look at the heavens, and see;
6If you have sinned, + what do you accomplish against him?
7+ If you are righteous, what do you give to him?
8Your wickedness concerns a man like yourself,
9“Because of the multitude of + oppressions people + cry out;
10But none says, ‘Where is God my + Maker,
11who teaches us + more than the beasts of the earth
12There they + cry out, but he does not answer,
13Surely God does not hear an empty cry,
14How much less when you say that you + do not see him,
15And now, because + his anger does not punish,
16Job opens his mouth in empty talk;
