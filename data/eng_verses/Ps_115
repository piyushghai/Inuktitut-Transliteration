1+ Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to your name give glory,
2Why should the nations say,
3+ Our God is in the heavens;
4+ Their idols are silver and gold,
5They have mouths, + but do not speak;
6They have ears, but do not hear;
7They have hands, but do not feel;
8+ Those who make them become like them;
9O + Israel,+ + trust in the Lord!
10O + house of Aaron, trust in the Lord!
11You + who fear the Lord, trust in the Lord!
12The Lord has remembered us; he will bless us;
13he will + bless those who fear the Lord,
14May the Lord+ give you increase,
15May + you be blessed by the Lord,
16The heavens are the Lordâ€™s heavens,
17+ The dead do not praise the Lord,
18But + we will bless the Lord
