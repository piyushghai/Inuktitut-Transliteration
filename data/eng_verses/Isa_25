1O Lord, + you are my God;
2For you have made the city + a heap,
3+ Therefore strong peoples will glorify you;
4+ For you have been a stronghold to the poor,
5+ like heat in a dry place.
6+ On this mountain the Lord of hosts will make for all peoples
7And he will swallow up + on this mountain
8+ He will swallow up death forever;
9It will be said on that day,
10For the hand of the Lord will rest + on this mountain,
11+ And he will spread out his hands in the midst of it
12And the high fortifications of his walls he will bring down,
