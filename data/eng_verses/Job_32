1So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was + righteous in his own eyes. 
2Then Elihu the son of Barachel + the Buzite, of the family of Ram, burned with anger. He burned with anger at Job because he justified himself + rather than God. 
3He burned with anger also at Job’s three friends because they had found no answer, although they had + declared Job to be in the wrong. 
4Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were older than he. 
5And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, he burned with anger.
6And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said:
7I said, ‘Let days speak,
8But it is + the spirit in man,
9+ It is not the old+  who are wise,
10Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me;
11“Behold, I waited for your words,
12I gave you my attention,
13Beware + lest you say, ‘We have found wisdom;
14He has not directed his words against me,
15“They are dismayed; they answer no more;
16And shall I wait, because they do not speak,
17I also will answer with my share;
18For I am full of words;
19Behold, my belly is like wine that has no vent;
20+ I must speak, that I may find + relief;
21I will not + show partiality to any man
22For I do not know how to flatter,
