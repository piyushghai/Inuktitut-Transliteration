1+ Concerning the Ammonites.
2Therefore, behold, the days are coming,
3“Wail, O + Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste!
4Why do you boast of your valleys,+ 
5Behold, + I will bring terror upon you,
6“But + afterward I will restore the fortunes of the Ammonites, declares the Lord.”
7Concerning + Edom.
8+ Flee, turn back, dwell in the depths,
9+ If grape gatherers came to you,
10+ But I have stripped Esau bare;
11+ Leave your fatherless children; I will keep them alive;
12For thus says the Lord: + “If those who did not deserve to drink the cup must drink it, + will you go unpunished? You shall not go unpunished, but you must drink. 
13+ For I have sworn by myself, declares the Lord, that + Bozrah shall become + a horror, a taunt, a waste, and a curse, and all her cities shall be perpetual wastes.”
14+ I have heard a message from the Lord,
15For behold, I will make you small among the nations,
16The horror you inspire has deceived you,
17+ “Edom shall become a horror. + Everyone who passes by it will be horrified + and will hiss because of all its disasters. 
18+ As when Sodom and Gomorrah and their + neighboring cities were overthrown, says the Lord, + no man shall dwell there, + no man shall sojourn in her. 
19+ Behold, + like a lion coming up from + the jungle of the Jordan against a perennial pasture, I will suddenly make him+  run away from her. And I will appoint over her whomever I choose. + For who is like me? + Who will summon me? + What shepherd can stand before me? 
20Therefore hear the plan that the Lord has made against + Edom and the purposes that he has formed against the inhabitants of + Teman: + Even the little ones of the flock shall be dragged away. Surely their fold shall be appalled at their fate. 
21At the sound of their fall + the earth shall tremble; the sound of their cry shall be heard at the Red Sea. 
22Behold, + one shall mount up and fly swiftly like an eagle and spread his wings against + Bozrah, and the heart of the warriors of Edom shall be in that day like the heart + of a woman in her birth pains.”
23Concerning + Damascus:
24+ Damascus has become feeble, + she turned to flee,
25How is + the famous city not forsaken,
26+ Therefore her young men shall fall in her squares,
27And + I will kindle a fire in the wall of + Damascus,
28Concerning + Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck down.
29+ Their tents and their flocks shall be taken,
30+ Flee, wander far away, dwell in the depths,
31+ “Rise up, advance against a nation + at ease,
32+ Their camels shall become plunder,
33Hazor shall become + a haunt of jackals,
34The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning + Elam, in the beginning of the reign of + Zedekiah king of Judah.
35Thus says the Lord of hosts: “Behold, I will break + the bow of + Elam, the mainstay of their might. 
36And I will bring upon + Elam the four winds from the four quarters of heaven. And I will scatter them to all those winds, and there shall be no nation to which those driven out of + Elam shall not come. 
37I will + terrify + Elam before their enemies and before those who seek their life. I will bring disaster upon them, + my fierce anger, declares the Lord. + I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them, 
38and I will set my throne in + Elam and destroy their king and officials, declares the Lord.
39“But in the latter days + I will restore the fortunes of + Elam, declares the Lord.”
