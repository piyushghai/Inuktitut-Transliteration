1Behold, + the Lord’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save,
2+ but your iniquities have made a separation
3+ For your hands are defiled with blood
4+ No one enters suit justly;
5They hatch adders’ eggs;
6+ Their webs will not serve as clothing;
7+ Their feet run to evil,
8The way of peace they do not know,
9Therefore justice is far from us,
10+ We grope for the wall like the blind;
11We all growl like bears;
12For our transgressions are multiplied before you,
13transgressing, and denying the Lord,
14+ Justice is turned back,
15Truth is lacking,
16+ He saw that there was no man,
17+ He put on righteousness as a breastplate,
18+ According to their deeds, so will he repay,
19+ So they shall fear the name of the Lord from the west,
20+ “And + a Redeemer will come to Zion,
21“And as for me, + this is my covenant with them,” says the Lord: “My Spirit that is upon you, + and my words that I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, or out of the mouth of your offspring, or out of the mouth of your children’s offspring,” says the Lord, “from this time forth and forevermore.”
