1“I + loathe my life;
2I will say to God, Do not + condemn me;
3+ Does it seem good to you to oppress,
4Have you + eyes of flesh?
5Are your days as the days of man,
6that you + seek out my iniquity
7although you + know that I am not guilty,
8+ Your hands fashioned and made me,
9Remember that you have made me like + clay;
10Did you not pour me out like milk
11You clothed me with skin and flesh,
12You have granted me life and steadfast love,
13Yet these things you hid in your heart;
14If I sin, you + watch me
15+ If I am guilty, woe to me!
16And were my head lifted up,+  you would hunt me like + a lion
17You renew your + witnesses against me
18+ “Why did you bring me out from the womb?
19+ and were as though I had not been,
20+ Are not my days few?
21before I go—and + I shall not return—
22the land of gloom like thick darkness,
