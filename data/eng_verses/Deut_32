1“Give ear, + O heavens, and I will speak,
2May + my teaching drop as the rain,
3For I will proclaim the name of the Lord;
4+ “The Rock, + his work is perfect,
5They have dealt corruptly with him;
6Do you thus repay the Lord,
7+ Remember the days of old;
8When the Most High + gave to the nations their inheritance,
9But the Lord’s portion is his people,
10“He found him + in a desert land,
11+ Like an eagle that stirs up its nest,
12+ the Lord alone guided him,
13+ He made him ride on the high places of the land,
14Curds from the herd, and milk from the flock,
15“But + Jeshurun grew fat, and + kicked;
16+ They stirred him to jealousy with strange gods;
17+ They sacrificed to demons that were no gods,
18You were unmindful of + the Rock that bore+  you,
19+ “The Lord saw it and spurned them,
20And he said, + ‘I will hide my face from them;
21+ They have made me jealous with what is no god;
22For + a fire is kindled by my anger,
23“‘And I will heap disasters upon them;
24they shall be wasted with hunger,
25+ Outdoors the sword shall bereave,
26+ I would have said, “I will cut them to pieces;
27had I not feared provocation by the enemy,
28“For they are a nation void of counsel,
29+ If they were wise, they would understand this;
30How could + one have chased a thousand,
31For + their rock is not as our Rock;
32For their vine + comes from the vine of Sodom
33their wine is the poison of + serpents
34“‘Is not this laid up in store with me,
35+ Vengeance is mine, and recompense,+ 
36For + the Lord will vindicate+  his people
37Then he will say, + ‘Where are their gods,
38who ate the fat of their sacrifices
39“‘See now that + I, even I, am he,
40For + I lift up my hand to heaven
41if I + sharpen my flashing sword+ 
42I will make my arrows drunk with blood,
43+ “Rejoice with him, O heavens;+ 
44Moses came and recited all the words of this song in the hearing of the people, he and + Joshua+  the son of Nun. 
45And when Moses had finished speaking all these words to all Israel, 
46he said to them, + “Take to heart all the words by which I am warning you today, + that you may command them to your children, that they may be careful to do all the words of this law. 
47For it is no empty word for you, + but your very life, and by this word you shall live long in the land that you are going over the Jordan to possess.”
48That very day the Lord spoke to Moses, 
49“Go up + this mountain of the Abarim, Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, opposite Jericho, and view the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the people of Israel for a possession. 
50And die on the mountain which you go up, and be gathered to your people, as + Aaron your brother died in Mount Hor and was gathered to his people, 
51+ because you broke faith with me in the midst of the people of Israel at the waters of Meribah-kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin, and because you did not treat me as holy in the midst of the people of Israel. 
52For + you shall see the land before you, but you shall not go there, into the land that I am giving to the people of Israel.”
