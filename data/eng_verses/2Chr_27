1+ Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His motherâ€™s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok. 
2And he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord according to all that his father Uzziah had done, + except he did not enter the temple of the Lord. But the people still followed corrupt practices. 
3He built the upper gate of the house of the Lord and did much building on the wall of + Ophel. 
4Moreover, he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and forts and towers on the wooded hills. 
5He fought with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed against them. And the Ammonites gave him that year 100 talents+  of silver, and 10,000 cors+  of wheat and 10,000 of barley. The Ammonites paid him the same amount in the second and the third years. 
6So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before the Lord his God. 
7+ Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. 
8He was + twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. 
9And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David, and Ahaz his son reigned in his place.
