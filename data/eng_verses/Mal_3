1+ “Behold, I send + my messenger, and + he will prepare the way before me. And the Lord + whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple; and + the messenger of the covenant in whom you delight, behold, he is coming, says the Lord of hosts. 
2But + who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears? For + he is like a refiner’s fire and like fullers’ soap. 
3He will sit + as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, and they will bring + offerings in righteousness to the Lord.+ 
4+ Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the Lord as in the days of old and as in former years.
5“Then I will draw near to you for judgment. I will be + a swift witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against those who swear falsely, against those + who oppress the hired worker in his wages, + the widow and the fatherless, against those who thrust aside the sojourner, and do not fear me, says the Lord of hosts.
6“For + I the Lord do not change; + therefore you, O children of Jacob, are not consumed. 
7+ From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from my statutes and have not kept them. + Return to me, and I will return to you, says the Lord of hosts. + But you say, ‘How shall we return?’ 
8Will man rob God? Yet you are robbing me. + But you say, ‘How have we robbed you?’ + In your tithes and contributions. 
9+ You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing me, the whole nation of you. 
10+ Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. And thereby + put me to the test, says the Lord of hosts, if I will not open + the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need. 
11I will rebuke + the devourer+  for you, so that it will not destroy the fruits of your soil, and your vine in the field shall not fail to bear, says the Lord of hosts. 
12Then + all nations will call you blessed, for you will be + a land of delight, says the Lord of hosts.
13+ “Your words have been hard against me, says the Lord. + But you say, ‘How have we spoken against you?’ 
14You have said, + ‘It is vain to serve God. + What is the profit of our keeping his charge or of walking as in mourning before the Lord of hosts? 
15And now we call + the arrogant blessed. + Evildoers not only prosper but + they put God to the test and they escape.’”
16Then those who feared the Lord+ spoke with one another. The Lord paid attention and heard them, and + a book of remembrance was written before him of those who feared the Lord and esteemed his name. 
17“They shall be mine, says the Lord of hosts, + in the day when I make up + my treasured possession, and I will spare them as a man spares his son who serves him. 
18Then once more you shall + see the distinction between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve him.
