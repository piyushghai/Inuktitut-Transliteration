1In the eighth month, + in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet + Zechariah, the son of + Berechiah, son of + Iddo, saying, 
2+ “The Lord was very angry with your fathers. 
3Therefore say to them, Thus declares the Lord of hosts: + Return to me, says the Lord of hosts, and + I will return to you, says the Lord of hosts. 
4+ Do not be like your fathers, + to whom the former prophets cried out, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, + Return from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.’ But + they did not hear or pay attention to me, declares the Lord. 
5Your fathers, where are they? And + the prophets, do they live forever? 
6+ But my words and my statutes, which I commanded + my servants the prophets, did they not + overtake your fathers? So they repented and said, + ‘As the Lord of hosts purposed to deal with us for + our ways and + deeds, so has he dealt with us.’”
7On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet + Zechariah, the son of + Berechiah, son of + Iddo, saying, 
8“I saw in the night, and behold, + a man riding on a red horse! He was standing among the myrtle trees in the glen, and behind him were + red, sorrel, and white horses. 
9Then I said, ‘What are these, my lord?’ + The angel who talked with me said to me, ‘I will show you what they are.’ 
10So + the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered, + ‘These are they whom the Lord has sent to + patrol the earth.’ 
11And they answered + the angel of the Lord who was standing among the myrtle trees, and said, + ‘We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth + remains at rest.’ 
12Then + the angel of the Lord said, + ‘O Lord of hosts, + how long will you + have no mercy on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, against which you have been angry these + seventy years?’ 
13And the Lord answered + gracious and comforting words to + the angel who talked with me. 
14So + the angel who talked with me said to me, ‘Cry out, Thus says the Lord of hosts: + I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion. 
15+ And I am exceedingly angry with the nations that are + at ease; + for while I was angry but a little, + they furthered the disaster. 
16Therefore, thus says the Lord, + I have returned to Jerusalem with mercy; + my house shall be built in it, declares the Lord of hosts, and + the measuring line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem. 
17Cry out again, Thus says the Lord of hosts: + My cities shall again overflow with prosperity, + and the Lord will again comfort Zion and again + choose Jerusalem.’”
18+  And I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, + four horns! 
19And I said to + the angel who talked with me, “What are these?” And he said to me, + “These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.” 
20Then the Lord showed me four craftsmen. 
21And I said, “What are these coming to do?” He said, + “These are the horns that scattered Judah, so that no one raised his head. And these have come + to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations + who lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter it.”
