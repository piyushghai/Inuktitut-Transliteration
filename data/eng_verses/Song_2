1I am a rose+  of Sharon,
2As a lily among brambles,
3As an apple tree among the trees of the forest,
4He + brought me to the banqueting house,+ 
5Sustain me with + raisins;
6His + left hand is under my head,
7I + adjure you,+  O + daughters of Jerusalem,
8The voice of my beloved!
9My beloved is like + a gazelle
10My beloved speaks and says to me:
11for behold, the winter is past;
12+ The flowers appear on the earth,
13+ The fig tree ripens its figs,
14O my + dove, in the + clefts of the rock,
15Catch + the foxes+  for us,
16+ My beloved is mine, and I am his;
17Until + the day breathes
