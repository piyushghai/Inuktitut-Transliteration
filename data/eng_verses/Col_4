1Masters, treat your bondservants justly and fairly, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.
2+ Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it + with thanksgiving. 
3At the same time, pray also for us, that God may + open to us a door for the word, + to declare the mystery of Christ, + on account of which I am in prison— 
4that I may make it clear, which is how I ought to speak.
5+ Walk in wisdom toward + outsiders, making the best use of the time. 
6Let your speech always + be gracious, + seasoned with salt, + so that you may know how you ought to answer each person.
7Tychicus will tell you + all about my activities. He is a beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow servant+  in the Lord. 
8I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are and that he may encourage your hearts, 
9and with him + Onesimus, our faithful and + beloved brother, who is one of you. They will tell you of everything that has taken place here.
10+ Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, and Mark + the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you have received instructions—+ if he comes to you, welcome him), 
11and Jesus who is called + Justus. + These are the only men of the circumcision among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and + they have been a comfort to me. 
12+ Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, greets you, always + struggling on your behalf in his prayers, that you may stand + mature and fully assured in all the will of God. 
13For I bear him witness that he has worked hard for you and for those in Laodicea and in Hierapolis. 
14+ Luke the beloved physician greets you, as does + Demas. 
15Give my greetings to the brothers+  at Laodicea, and to Nympha and + the church in her house. 
16And when + this letter has been read among you, have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans; and see that you also read the letter from Laodicea. 
17And say to + Archippus, “See that you fulfill + the ministry that you have received in the Lord.”
18I, Paul, + write this greeting with my own hand. + Remember + my chains. + Grace be with you.
