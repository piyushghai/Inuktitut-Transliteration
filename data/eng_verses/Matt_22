1And again Jesus + spoke to them in parables, saying, 
2+ “The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave + a wedding feast for his son,
3and + sent his servants+ to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come.
4+ Again he sent other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, “See, I have prepared my + dinner, + my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.”’
5But + they paid no attention and went off, one to his farm, another to his business,
6while the rest seized his servants, + treated them shamefully, and + killed them.
7The king was angry, and he sent his troops and + destroyed those murderers and burned their city.
8Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not + worthy.
9Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find.’
10And those servants went out into the roads and + gathered all whom they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with guests.
11“But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there + a man who had no wedding garment.
12And he said to him, + ‘Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?’ And he was speechless.
13Then the king said to the attendants, ‘Bind him hand and foot and + cast him into the outer darkness. In that place + there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’
14For many are + called, but few are + chosen.”
15+ Then the Pharisees went and plotted how + to entangle him in his words. 
16And they sent + their disciples to him, along with + the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, + we know that you are true and teach + the way of God truthfully, and you do not care about anyone’s opinion, for + you are not swayed by appearances.+ 
17Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay + taxes to + Caesar, or not?” 
18But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, “Why + put me to the test, you hypocrites? 
19Show me the coin for the tax.” And they brought him a denarius.+ 
20And Jesus said to them, “Whose likeness and inscription is this?” 
21They said, “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them, + “Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” 
22When they heard it, they marveled. And they + left him and went away.
23The same day + Sadducees came to him, + who say that there is no resurrection, and they asked him a question, 
24saying, “Teacher, Moses said, + ‘If a man dies having no children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.’ 
25Now there were seven brothers among us. The first married and died, and having no offspring left his wife to his brother. 
26So too the second and third, down to the seventh. 
27After them all, the woman died. 
28In the resurrection, therefore, of the seven, whose wife will she be? For they all had her.”
29But Jesus answered them, “You are wrong, + because you know neither the Scriptures nor + the power of God.
30For in the resurrection they neither + marry nor + are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
31And as for the resurrection of the dead, + have you not read what was said to you by God:
32+ ‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not God of the dead, but of the living.”
33And when the crowd heard it, + they were astonished at his teaching.
34+ But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced + the Sadducees, they gathered together. 
35+ And one of them, + a lawyer, asked him a question + to test him. 
36“Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?” 
37And he said to him, + “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. 
38This is the great and first commandment. 
39And + a second is like it: + You shall love your neighbor as yourself. 
40+ On these two commandments depend + all the Law and the Prophets.”
41+ Now while the Pharisees + were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, 
42saying, “What do you think about + the Christ? Whose son is he?” They said to him, + “The son of David.” 
43He said to them, “How is it then that David, + in the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying,
44+ “‘The Lord said to my Lord,
45If then David calls him Lord, + how is he his son?”
46+ And no one was able to answer him a word, + nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions.
