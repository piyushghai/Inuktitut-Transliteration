1+ The earth is the Lordâ€™s and the fullness thereof,+ 
2for he has + founded it upon + the seas
3+ Who shall ascend the hill of the Lord?
4+ He who has + clean hands and + a pure heart,
5He will receive + blessing from the Lord
6Such is + the generation of those who seek him,
7+ Lift up your heads, O gates!
8Who is this King of glory?
9Lift up your heads, O gates!
10Who is this King of glory?
