1+ My heart is steadfast, O God!
2Awake, O harp and lyre!
3I will give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples;
4For your steadfast love is great + above the heavens;
5Be exalted, O God, above the heavens!
6+ That your beloved ones may be delivered,
7God has promised in his holiness:+ 
8Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine;
9Moab is my washbasin;
10Who will bring me to the fortified city?
11Have you not rejected us, O God?
12Oh grant us help against the foe,
13With God we shall do valiantly;
