1The word of the Lord that came to Zephaniah the son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah, + in the days of + Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.
2+ “I will utterly sweep away everything
3“I will sweep away + man and beast;
4“I will stretch out my hand against Judah
5+ those who bow down on the roofs
6+ those who have turned back from following the Lord,
7+ Be silent before the Lord God!
8And on the day of the Lord’s sacrifice—
9On that day I will punish
10“On that day,” declares the Lord,
11+ Wail, O inhabitants of the Mortar!
12At that time + I will search Jerusalem with lamps,
13Their goods shall be + plundered,
14+ The great day of the Lord is near,
15+ A day of wrath is that day,
16+ a day of trumpet blast and battle cry
17+ I will bring distress on mankind,
18+ Neither their silver nor their gold
