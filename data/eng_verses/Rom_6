1What shall we say then? + Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? 
2By no means! How can + we who died to sin still live in it? 
3Do you not know that all of us + who have been baptized + into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 
4We were + buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as + Christ was raised from the dead by + the glory of the Father, we too might walk in + newness of life.
5For + if we have been united with him in + a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. 
6We know that + our old self+ + was crucified with him in order that + the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. 
7For + one who has died + has been set free+  from sin. 
8Now + if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. 
9We know that + Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; + death no longer has dominion over him. 
10For the death he died he died to sin, + once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. 
11So you also must consider yourselves + dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.
12Let not + sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to make you obey its passions. 
13+ Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but + present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness. 
14For + sin + will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.
15What then? + Are we to sin + because we are not under law but under grace? By no means! 
16Do you not know that if you present yourselves + to anyone as obedient slaves,+  you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness? 
17But + thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the + standard of teaching to which you were committed, 
18and, + having been set free from sin, + have become slaves of righteousness. 
19+ I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For + just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members + as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.
20+ For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. 
21+ But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things + of which you are now ashamed? + For the end of those things is death. 
22But now that you + have been set free from sin and + have become slaves of God, + the fruit you get leads to sanctification and + its end, eternal life. 
23+ For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
