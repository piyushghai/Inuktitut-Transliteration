1Then Job answered and said:
2“How long will you torment me
3These + ten times you have cast reproach upon me;
4And even if it be true that I have erred,
5If indeed you + magnify yourselves against me
6know then that God has + put me in the wrong
7Behold, I + cry out, ‘Violence!’ but I am not answered;
8He has + walled up my way, so that I cannot pass,
9He has + stripped from me my glory
10He breaks me down on every side, and I + am gone,
11He has kindled his wrath against me
12His + troops come on together;
13“He has put my + brothers far from me,
14My relatives + have failed me,
15The guests + in my house and my maidservants count me as a stranger;
16I call to my servant, but he gives me no answer;
17My breath is strange to my + wife,
18Even young + children despise me;
19All my + intimate friends abhor me,
20My + bones stick to my skin and to my flesh,
21Have mercy on me, have mercy on me, O you my friends,
22Why do you, like God, + pursue me?
23“Oh that my words were written!
24Oh that with an iron + pen and lead
25For I + know that my + Redeemer lives,
26And after my skin has been thus destroyed,
27whom I shall see for myself,
28If you say, ‘How we will + pursue him!’
29be afraid of the sword,
