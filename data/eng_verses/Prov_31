1The words of King Lemuel. An oracle that his mother taught him:
2What are you doing, my son?+  What are you doing, + son of my womb?
3Do + not give your strength to women,
4+ It is not for kings, O Lemuel,
5lest they drink and forget what has been decreed
6Give strong drink to the one who + is perishing,
7+ let them drink and forget their poverty
8+ Open your mouth for the mute,
9Open your mouth, + judge righteously,
10+ + An excellent wife who can find?
11The heart of her husband trusts in her,
12She does him good, and not harm,
13She + seeks wool and flax,
14She is like the ships of the merchant;
15She + rises while it is yet night
16She considers a field and buys it;
17She + dresses herself+  with strength
18She perceives that her merchandise is profitable.
19She puts her hands to the distaff,
20She + opens her hand to + the poor
21She is not afraid of snow for her household,
22She makes + bed coverings for herself;
23Her husband is known in + the gates
24She makes + linen garments and sells them;
25+ Strength and dignity are her clothing,
26She opens her mouth with wisdom,
27She looks well to the ways of her household
28Her children rise up and call her blessed;
29â€œMany + women have done + excellently,
30+ Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain,
31Give her of the fruit of her hands,
