1+ Working together with him, then, + we appeal to you + not to receive the grace of God in vain. 
2For he says,
3We + put no obstacle in anyoneâ€™s way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry, 
4but + as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: + by great endurance, + in afflictions, + hardships, calamities, 
5+ beatings, imprisonments, + riots, labors, sleepless nights, hunger; 
6+ by purity, + knowledge, patience, kindness, + the Holy Spirit, + genuine love; 
7by + truthful speech, and + the power of God; with + the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left; 
8through honor and dishonor, + through slander and praise. We are treated as impostors, and yet are true; 
9as unknown, and + yet well known; + as dying, and behold, we live; + as punished, and yet not killed; 
10+ as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; + as poor, yet making many rich; + as having nothing, + yet possessing everything.
11We have spoken freely to you,+  Corinthians; + our heart is wide open. 
12You are not restricted by us, but + you are restricted in your own affections. 
13+ In return (I speak + as to children) widen your hearts also.
14+ Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For + what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or + what fellowship has light with darkness? 
15+ What accord has Christ with Belial?+  Or what portion does a believer share with an unbeliever? 
16What agreement has the temple of God with idols? For + we are the temple of the living God; as God said,
17Therefore + go out from their midst,
18+ and I will be a father to you,
