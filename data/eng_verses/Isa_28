1Ah, the proud crown of + the drunkards of Ephraim,
2Behold, the Lord has + one who is mighty and strong;
3+ The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim
4+ and the fading flower of its glorious beauty,
5+ In that day the Lord of hosts will be a crown of glory,+ 
6and + a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment,
7+ These also reel with wine
8For all tables are full of filthy vomit,
9+ “To whom will he teach knowledge,
10For it is precept upon precept, precept upon precept,
11+ For by people of strange lips
12to whom he has said,
13And the word of the Lord will be to them
14Therefore hear the word of the Lord, you + scoffers,
15Because you have said, “We have made a covenant with death,
16therefore thus says the Lord God,
17And I will make justice + the line,
18Then + your covenant with death will be annulled,
19As often as it passes through it will take you;
20For the bed is too short to stretch oneself on,
21For the Lord will rise up + as on Mount Perazim;
22Now therefore do not + scoff,
23Give ear, and hear my voice;
24Does he who plows for sowing plow continually?
25+ When he has leveled its surface,
26+ For he is rightly instructed;
27Dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge,
28Does one crush grain for bread?
29This also comes from the Lord of hosts;
