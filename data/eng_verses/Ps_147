1+ Praise the Lord!
2The Lord+ builds up Jerusalem;
3He heals + the brokenhearted
4He + determines the number of the stars;
5+ Great is our Lord, and + abundant in power;
6The Lord+ lifts up the humble;+ 
7+ Sing to the Lord with thanksgiving;
8He covers the heavens with clouds;
9He + gives to the beasts their food,
10His delight is not in + the strength of the horse,
11but the Lord+ takes pleasure in those who fear him,
12Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem!
13For he strengthens + the bars of your gates;
14He + makes peace in your borders;
15He + sends out his command to the earth;
16He gives + snow like wool;
17He hurls down his crystals of + ice like crumbs;
18He + sends out his word, and melts them;
19He declares his word to Jacob,
20He + has not dealt thus with any other nation;
