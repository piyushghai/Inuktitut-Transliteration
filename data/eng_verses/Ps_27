1The Lord is my + light and my + salvation;
2When evildoers assail me
3+ Though an army encamp against me,
4+ One thing have I asked of the Lord,
5For he will + hide me in his shelter
6And now my + head shall be lifted up
7+ Hear, O Lord, when I cry aloud;
8You have said, + “Seek+  my face.”
9+ Hide not your face from me.
10For + my father and my mother have forsaken me,
11+ Teach me your way, O Lord,
12+ Give me not up to the will of my adversaries;
13I believe+  that I shall look upon + the goodness of the Lord
14+ Wait for the Lord;
