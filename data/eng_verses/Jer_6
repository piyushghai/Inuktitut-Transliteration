1Flee for safety, + O people of Benjamin,
2The lovely and delicately bred I will destroy,
3+ Shepherds with their flocks shall come against her;
4+ “Prepare war against her;
5Arise, and let us attack by night
6For thus says the Lord of hosts:
7+ As a well keeps its water fresh,
8Be warned, O Jerusalem,
9Thus says the Lord of hosts:
10+ To whom shall I speak and give warning,
11Therefore I am full of the wrath of the Lord;
12+ Their houses shall be turned over to others,
13+ “For from the least to the greatest of them,
14They have healed the wound of my people lightly,
15+ Were they ashamed when they committed abomination?
16Thus says the Lord:
17+ I set watchmen over you, saying,
18Therefore hear, O nations,
19Hear, O earth; behold, I am bringing disaster upon this people,
20+ What use to me is + frankincense that comes from + Sheba,
21Therefore thus says the Lord:
22Thus says the Lord:
23They lay hold on bow and javelin;
24We have heard the report of it;
25Go not out into the field,
26O daughter of my people, + put on sackcloth,
27“I have made you + a tester of metals among my people,
28+ They are all stubbornly rebellious,
29The + bellows blow fiercely;
30+ Rejected silver they are called,
