1Gather together, yes, gather,
2+ before the decree takes effect+ 
3+ Seek the Lord, + all you humble of the land,
4+ For Gaza shall be deserted,
5Woe to + you inhabitants of the seacoast,
6+ And you, O seacoast, + shall be pastures,
7+ The seacoast shall become the possession
8“I have heard + the taunts of Moab
9Therefore, + as I live,” declares the Lord of hosts,
10This shall be their lot in return + for their pride,
11The Lord will be awesome against them;
12+ You also, O Cushites,
13And he will stretch out his hand against the north
14+ Herds shall lie down in her midst,
15This is the exultant city
