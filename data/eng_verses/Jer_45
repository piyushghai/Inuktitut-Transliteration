1The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to + Baruch the son of Neriah, + when he wrote these words in a book at the dictation of Jeremiah, + in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: 
2“Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch: 
3You said, + ‘Woe is me! For the Lord has added sorrow to my pain. + I am weary with my groaning, + and I find no rest.’ 
4Thus shall you say to him, Thus says the Lord: + Behold, what I have built I am breaking down, and what I have planted I am plucking up—that is, the whole land. 
5And + do you seek great things for yourself? Seek them not, for behold, + I am bringing disaster upon all flesh, declares the Lord. But I will give you + your life as a prize of war in all places to which you may go.”
