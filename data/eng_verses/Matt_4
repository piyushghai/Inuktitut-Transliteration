1+ Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness + to be tempted by the devil. 
2And after fasting + forty days and forty nights, he + was hungry. 
3And + the tempter came and said to him, “If you are + the Son of God, command + these stones to become loaves of bread.” 
4But he answered, + “It is written,
5+ Then the devil took him to + the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple 
6and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written,
7Jesus said to him, “Again + it is written, + ‘You shall not + put the Lord your God to the test.’”
8+ Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. 
9And he said to him, “All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.” 
10Then Jesus said to him, “Be gone, + Satan! For + it is written,
11Then the devil left him, and behold, + angels came and were ministering to him.
12Now when he heard that + John had been arrested, + he withdrew into Galilee. 
13And leaving + Nazareth he went and lived in + Capernaum by + the sea, in the territory of + Zebulun and Naphtali, 
14+ so that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:
15+ “The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
16+ the people dwelling in darkness
17+ From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, + “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”
18+ While walking by + the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (who is called Peter) and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. 
19And he said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you + fishers of men.”+ 
20Immediately they left their nets and followed him. 
21And going on from there he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them. 
22Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.
23+ And he went throughout all Galilee, + teaching in their synagogues and + proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and + healing every disease and every affliction among the people. 
24So his fame spread throughout all + Syria, and + they brought him all the sick, those afflicted with various diseases and + pains, + those oppressed by demons, + epileptics, and + paralytics, and he healed them. 
25+ And great crowds followed him from Galilee and the + Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.
