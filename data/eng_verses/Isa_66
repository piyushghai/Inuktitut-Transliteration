1+ Thus says the Lord:
2+ All these things my hand has made,
3+ “He who slaughters an ox is like one who kills a man;
4+ I also will choose harsh treatment for them
5Hear the word of the Lord,
6“The sound of an uproar from the city!
7+ “Before she was in labor
8Who has heard such a thing?
9Shall I bring to the point of birth and not cause to bring forth?”
10+ “Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad for her,
11that you may nurse and be satisfied
12For thus says the Lord:
13As one whom his mother comforts,
14You shall see, and your heart shall rejoice;
15“For behold, + the Lord will come in fire,
16For + by fire + will the Lord enter into judgment,
17+ “Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following one in the midst, + eating pig’s flesh and the abomination and mice, shall come to an end together, declares the Lord.
18“For I know+  their works and their thoughts, and the time is coming+ + to gather all nations and tongues. And they shall come and shall see my glory, 
19and I will set a sign among them. And from them + I will send survivors to the nations, to + Tarshish, + Pul, and + Lud, who draw the bow, to + Tubal and + Javan, + to the coastlands far away, + that have not heard my fame or seen my glory. And they shall declare my glory among the nations. 
20+ And they shall bring all your brothers from all the nations + as an offering to the Lord, on horses and in chariots and in litters and on mules and on dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says the Lord, just as the Israelites bring their grain offering in a clean vessel to the house of the Lord. 
21+ And some of them also I will take for priests and for Levites, says the Lord.
22“For as + the new heavens and the new earth
23+ From new moon to new moon,
24“And they shall go out and look on the dead bodies of the men who have rebelled against me. For + their worm shall not die, + their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.”
