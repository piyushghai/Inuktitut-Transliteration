1+ My son, keep my words
2+ keep my commandments and live;
3+ bind them on your fingers;
4Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,”
5to keep you from + the forbidden+  woman,
6For at + the window of my house
7and I have seen among + the simple,
8passing along the street + near her corner,
9in + the twilight, in the evening,
10And behold, the woman meets him,
11She is + loud and + wayward;
12now in the street, now in the market,
13She seizes him and kisses him,
14“I had to + offer sacrifices,+ 
15so now I have come out to meet you,
16I have spread my couch with + coverings,
17I have perfumed my bed with + myrrh,
18Come, let us take our fill of love till morning;
19For + my husband is not at home;
20he took a bag of money with him;
21With much seductive speech she persuades him;
22All at once he follows her,
23till an arrow pierces its liver;
24And + now, O sons, listen to me,
25Let not your heart turn aside to her ways;
26for many a victim has she laid low,
27Her house is + the way to Sheol,
