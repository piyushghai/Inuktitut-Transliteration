1Hear my prayer, O Lord;
2+ Enter not into judgment with your servant,
3For the enemy has pursued my soul;
4Therefore my spirit + faints within me;
5+ I remember the days of old;
6+ I stretch out my hands to you;
7+ Answer me quickly, O Lord!
8+ Let me hear in the morning of your steadfast love,
9+ Deliver me from my enemies, O Lord!
10+ Teach me to do your will,
11+ For your nameâ€™s sake, O Lord, + preserve my life!
12And in your steadfast love you will + cut off my enemies,
