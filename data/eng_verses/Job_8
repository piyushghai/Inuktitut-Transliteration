1Then + Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
2“How long will you say these things,
3+ Does God pervert justice?
4If your + children have sinned against him,
5If you will seek God
6if you are pure and upright,
7And though your beginning was small,
8“For + inquire, please, of bygone ages,
9For we are but of yesterday and know nothing,
10Will they not teach you and tell you
11“Can papyrus grow where there is no marsh?
12While yet in flower and not cut down,
13Such are the paths of all who + forget God;
14His confidence is severed,
15He leans against his + house, but it does not stand;
16He is a lush plant before the sun,
17His roots entwine the stone heap;
18If he is destroyed from his + place,
19Behold, this is the joy of his way,
20“Behold, God will not reject a blameless man,
21He will yet + fill your mouth with laughter,
22Those who hate you will be + clothed with shame,
