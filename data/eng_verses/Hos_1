1The word of the Lord that came to Hosea, the son of Beeri, + in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of + Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.
2When the Lord first spoke through Hosea, the Lord said to Hosea, + “Go, take to yourself a wife of whoredom and have + children of whoredom, for + the land commits great whoredom by forsaking the Lord.” 
3So he went and took Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.
4And the Lord said to him, “Call his name Jezreel, for in just a little while + I will punish the house of Jehu for the blood of Jezreel, and + I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel. 
5And on that day + I will break the bow of Israel + in the Valley of Jezreel.”
6She conceived again and bore a daughter. And the Lord said to him, + “Call her name No Mercy,+  for + I will no more have mercy on the house of Israel, to forgive them at all. 
7But + I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and I will save them by the Lord their God. I + will not save them by bow or by sword or by war or by horses or by horsemen.”
8When she had weaned No Mercy, she conceived and bore a son. 
9And the Lord said, + “Call his name Not My People,+  for + you are not my people, and I am not your God.”+ 
10+  Yet + the number of the children of Israel shall be + like the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or numbered. + And + in the place where it was said to them, + “You are not my people,” it shall be said to them, + “Children+  of + the living God.” 
11And + the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and + they shall appoint for themselves one head. And they shall go up from the land, for great shall be the day of Jezreel.
