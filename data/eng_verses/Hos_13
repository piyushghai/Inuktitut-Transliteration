1When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling;
2And now they sin more and more,
3Therefore they shall be + like the morning mist
4But + I am the Lord your God
5+ It was I who knew you in the wilderness,
6+ but when they had grazed,+  they became full,
7So + I am to them like a lion;
8I will fall upon them + like a bear robbed of her cubs;
9He destroys+  you, O Israel,
10+ Where now is your king, to save you in all your cities?
11+ I gave you a king in my anger,
12The iniquity of Ephraim is + bound up;
13+ The pangs of childbirth come for him,
14+ Shall I ransom them from the power of Sheol?
15Though + he may flourish among his brothers,
16+  Samaria + shall bear her guilt,
