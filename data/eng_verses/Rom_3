1Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision? 
2Much in every way. To begin with, + the Jews were entrusted with + the oracles of God. 
3+ What if some were unfaithful? + Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God? 
4By no means! + Let God be true though + every one were a liar, as it is written,
5But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unrighteous to inflict + wrath on us? (+ I speak in a human way.) 
6By no means! For then how could + God judge the world? 
7But if through my lie God’s truth abounds to his glory, + why am I still being condemned as a sinner? 
8And why not + do evil that good may come?—as some people slanderously charge us with saying. Their condemnation is just.
9What then? Are we Jews+  any better off?+  No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both + Jews and + Greeks, are + under sin, 
10as it is written:
11no one understands;
12All have turned aside; together they have become worthless;
13+ “Their throat is + an open grave;
14+ “Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.”
15+ “Their feet are swift to shed blood;
16in their paths are ruin and misery,
17and + the way of peace they have not known.”
18+ “There is no fear of God before their eyes.”
19Now we know that whatever + the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, + so that every mouth may be stopped, and + the whole world may be held accountable to God. 
20For + by works of the law no human being+  will be justified in his sight, since + through the law comes knowledge of sin.
21But now + the righteousness of God + has been manifested apart from the law, although + the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it— 
22the righteousness of God + through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. + For there is no distinction: 
23for + all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 
24+ and are justified + by his grace as a gift, + through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, 
25whom God + put forward as + a propitiation + by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God’s righteousness, because in + his divine forbearance he had passed over + former sins. 
26It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.
27+ Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith. 
28For we hold that one is justified by faith + apart from works of the law. 
29Or + is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, 
30since + God is one—who will justify the circumcised by faith and + the uncircumcised through faith. 
31Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.
