1Woe to + the bloody city,
2The crack of the whip, and + rumble of the wheel,
3Horsemen charging,
4And all for the countless whorings of the + prostitute,
5+ Behold, I am against you,
6I will throw filth at you
7And all who look at you + will shrink from you and say,
8+ Are you better than + Thebes+ 
9+ Cush was her strength;
10+ Yet she became an exile;
11+ You also will be drunken;
12All your fortresses are + like fig trees
13Behold, your troops
14+ Draw water for the siege;
15There will the fire devour you;
16You increased + your merchants
17Your + princes are + like grasshoppers,
18Your shepherds + are asleep,
19There is no easing your hurt;
