1+ It is good to give thanks to the Lord,
2to declare your + steadfast love in + the morning,
3to the music of + the lute and + the harp,
4For you, O Lord, have made me glad by your + work;
5How + great are your works, O Lord!
6The stupid man cannot know;
7that though + the wicked sprout like grass
8but you, O Lord, are + on high forever.
9For behold, your enemies, O Lord,
10But you have exalted my + horn like that of + the wild ox;
11My + eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies;
12+ The righteous flourish like the palm tree
13They are planted in the house of the Lord;
14They still bear fruit in old age;
15+ to declare that the Lord is upright;
