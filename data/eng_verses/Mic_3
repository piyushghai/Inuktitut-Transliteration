1And I said:
2you + who hate the good and love the evil,
3+ who eat the flesh of my people,
4+ Then they will cry to the Lord,
5Thus says the Lord concerning + the prophets
6Therefore + it shall be night to you, without vision,
7+ the seers shall be disgraced,
8But as for me, + I am filled with power,
9+ Hear this, you heads of the house of Jacob
10+ who build Zion with blood
11+ Its heads give judgment for a bribe;
12Therefore because of you
