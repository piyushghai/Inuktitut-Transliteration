1Transgression speaks to the wicked
2+ For he flatters himself in his own eyes
3The words of his mouth are + trouble and deceit;
4He + plots + trouble while on his bed;
5Your steadfast love, O Lord, extends to the heavens,
6+ Your righteousness is like the mountains of God;
7+ How precious is your steadfast love, O God!
8They feast on + the abundance of your house,
9For with you is + the fountain of life;
10Oh, continue your steadfast love to those who + know you,
11Let not the foot of arrogance come upon me,
12There + the evildoers lie fallen;
