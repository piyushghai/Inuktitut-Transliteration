1+ Hear this word that the Lord has spoken against you, O people of Israel, against the whole family that I brought up out of the land of Egypt:
2+ “You only have I known
3“Do two walk together,
4Does a lion roar in the forest,
5Does a bird fall in a snare on the earth,
6+ Is a trumpet blown in a city,
7“For the Lord God does nothing
8The lion has roared;
9Proclaim to the strongholds in + Ashdod
10“They do not know how to do right,” declares the Lord,
11Therefore thus says the Lord God:
12Thus says the Lord: + “As the shepherd rescues from the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear, + so shall the people of Israel + who dwell in Samaria be rescued, with the corner of a couch and part+  of a bed.
13“Hear, + and testify against the house of Jacob,”
14“that on the day I punish Israel for his transgressions,
15+ I will strike + the winter house along with + the summer house,
