1The words of + the Preacher,+  the son of David, + king in Jerusalem.
2+ Vanity+  of vanities, says + the Preacher,
3+ What + does man gain by all the toil
4A generation goes, and a generation comes,
5+ The sun rises, and the sun goes down,
6+ The wind blows to the south
7All + streams run to the sea,
8All things are full of weariness;
9+ What has been is what will be,
10Is there a thing of which it is said,
11There is no + remembrance of former things,+ 
12I + the Preacher have been king over Israel in Jerusalem. 
13And I + applied my heart+  to seek and to search out by wisdom all that is done under heaven. It is an unhappy + business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with. 
14I have seen everything that is done under the sun, and behold, all is + vanity+  and a striving after wind.+ 
15+ What is crooked cannot be made straight,
16I said in my heart, “I have acquired great + wisdom, surpassing all who were over Jerusalem before me, and my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.” 
17And I + applied my heart to know wisdom and to know + madness and folly. I perceived that this also is but + a striving after wind.
18For + in much wisdom is much vexation,
