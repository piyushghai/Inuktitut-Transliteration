1Why, O Lord, do you stand + far away?
2In arrogance the wicked hotly pursue the poor;
3For the wicked + boasts of the desires of his soul,
4In the pride of his face+  the wicked does not + seek him;+ 
5His ways prosper at all times;
6He + says in his heart, “I shall not be moved;
7+ His mouth is filled with cursing and + deceit and + oppression;
8He sits in ambush in the villages;
9he lurks in ambush like + a lion in his + thicket;
10The helpless are crushed, sink down,
11He says in his heart, “God has forgotten,
12+ Arise, O Lord; O God, + lift up your hand;
13Why does the wicked + renounce God
14But you do see, for you + note mischief and vexation,
15+ Break the arm of the wicked and evildoer;
16+ The Lord is king forever and ever;
17O Lord, you hear the desire of the afflicted;
18to + do justice to the fatherless and + the oppressed,
