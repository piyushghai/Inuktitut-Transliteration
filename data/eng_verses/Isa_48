1Hear this, O house of Jacob,
2For they call themselves after the holy city,
3“The former things + I declared of old;
4Because I know that + you are obstinate,
5+ I declared them to you from of old,
6“You have heard; now see all this;
7They are created now, not long ago;
8You have never heard, you have never known,
9+ “For my name’s sake I defer my anger,
10Behold, I have refined you, + but not as silver;
11+ For my own sake, for my own sake, I do it,
12“Listen to me, O Jacob,
13My hand + laid the foundation of the earth,
14“Assemble, all of you, and listen!
15+ I, even I, have spoken and called him;
16+ Draw near to me, hear this:
17Thus says the Lord,
18+ Oh that you had paid attention to my commandments!
19+ your offspring would have been like the sand,
20+ Go out from Babylon, flee from + Chaldea,
21+ They did not thirst when he led them through the deserts;
22+ “There is no peace,” says the Lord, “for the wicked.”
