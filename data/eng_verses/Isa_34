1Draw near, + O nations, to hear,
2For the Lord is enraged against all the nations,
3Their slain shall be cast out,
4+ All the host of heaven shall rot away,
5For my sword has drunk its fill in the heavens;
6The Lord has a sword; it is sated with blood;
7+ Wild oxen shall + fall with them,
8+ For the Lord has a day of vengeance,
9+ And the streams of Edom+  shall be turned into pitch,
10Night and day + it shall not be quenched;
11+ But the hawk and the porcupine+  shall possess it,
12Its noblesâ€”there is no one there to call it a kingdom,
13+ Thorns shall grow over its strongholds,
14+ And wild animals shall meet with hyenas;
15There the owl nests and lays
16Seek and read from the book of the Lord:
17+ He has cast the lot for them;
