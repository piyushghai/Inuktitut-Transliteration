1+ Shout for joy in the Lord, O you righteous!
2Give thanks to the Lord with the + lyre;
3Sing to him + a new song;
4For the word of the Lord is upright,
5He + loves righteousness and justice;
6By + the word of the Lord the heavens were made,
7He gathers the waters of the sea as + a heap;
8Let all the earth fear the Lord;
9For + he spoke, and it came to be;
10The Lord+ brings the counsel of the nations to nothing;
11+ The counsel of the Lord stands forever,
12+ Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord,
13The Lord+ looks down from heaven;
14from + where he sits enthroned he + looks out
15he who fashions the hearts of them all
16+ The king is not saved by his great army;
17+ The war horse is a false hope for salvation,
18Behold, + the eye of the Lord is on those who fear him,
19that he may + deliver their soul from death
20Our soul + waits for the Lord;
21For our heart is + glad in him,
22Let your steadfast love, O Lord, be upon us,
